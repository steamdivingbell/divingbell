{"about_the_game":"&quot;Strange And Mysterious Domain&quot;is a game that combines the Cthulhu COC tabletop RPG with a bizarre exploration and puzzle-solving adventure. Here, you might be a detective, a teacher, or many other roles. Solving various incidents is your goal, and it is one of the paths to unraveling the ultimate mystery. Whatever the ending, it will be part of your own story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame Features<br />\r\nDice System<br />\r\nIn the game, your actions are accompanied by dice rolls. The results, compared with your attributes, lead you down different story paths. There are no right or wrong choices; Lady Luck is your greatest ally. If one critical success can't solve the problem, then roll two!<br />\r\nMaximum Freedom<br />\r\nThe game encourages you to explore rather than forcing you down a specific path (main storyline). All events can be side quests or main quests, depending on your choices. You can be a participant in the story, an observer, or completely unrelated. You can be the protagonist, a supporting character, or even one of the many NPCs. We encourage players to explore various aspects of the game and collect different clues to piece together a comprehensive story and make their own choices.<br />\r\nCombat System<br />\r\nUnlike traditional COC tabletop RPGs, we've added our own real-time combat to let players enjoy fighting bosses while exploring the story. However, due to current limitations, the originally planned eerie roguelike combat system might not be available for now. We still retain the original combat system, and its future inclusion will depend on crowdfunding results.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3090680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737021906","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3090680/page.bg.jpg?t=1737021906","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3090680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737021906","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3090680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737021906","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3358000,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"&quot;Strange And Mysterious Domain&quot;is a game that combines the Cthulhu COC tabletop RPG with a bizarre exploration and puzzle-solving adventure.
