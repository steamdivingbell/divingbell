A player finds themselves in a strange and unfamiliar world - they don't know where they are or how they got there. And it appears they don't remember anything up to this point. Almost immediately the player is contacted by a group of characters with similar symptoms and together they start an investigation to unravel these mysteries. Where are they? Why can't they remember anything? These and many other questions will be answered in the most unexpected ways.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454570/extras/Steam_Gp.png?t=1606810818\" /><br>At its core, Lost Voice is a first-person shooter, with strong exploration and some puzzle elements.

Instead of dying, the player teleports to the Well when HP is depleted. Upon climbing the Well to the top, the player transports to the Secret Room, nearest to the player\u2019s &quot;death&quot; location. These rooms are closed from the inside, so the player will need to figure out how to unlock them.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1606810818","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1606810818","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1606810818","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1606810818","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1454570/extras/Steam_St.png?t=1606810818\" /><br>At first glance, the story is simple, if not cliched.
