A large portion of the combat will be enemy fighters that are fast and agile keeping you on your toes.  While in areial combat with these fighters, you will also have to attack a variety of highly defended strategic targets, such as massive airships and overcome the defenses of heavily defended city-platforms. <br><br>As you dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge in the air, you will also have to manage your AI wingmen who are sworn to protect you. You can direct them to protect you in a defensive formation, attack a selected target, escort the player, use abilities and more; all to manage their battlefield presence. If poorly managed the player may become overwhelmed and defeated. But if managed properly your squad can become a dominating fighting force on the battlefield.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467850/extras/discord.png?t=1689015879\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join us on Discord!</h2>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689015879","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467850/page.bg.jpg?t=1689015879","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689015879","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689015879","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1467850/extras/storysofar.png?t=1689015879\" /><br><br><i>The world is dying.
