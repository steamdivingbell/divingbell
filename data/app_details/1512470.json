{"about_the_game":"<i>The abstract male is the image of God, the absolute something.</i><br><br>Sam isn't exactly looking for a girlfriend.

It has been available in early access starting Spring 2021. The full version of the game was released Summer 2021.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Themes</h2>Through it's narrative, Incel Syndrome attempts to present a nuanced view of Incel subculture, as opposed to the caricatures that are frequently depicted. The game explores currents within contemporary internet-culture, contrasting them against the theories of Otto Weininger \u2014 a young Austrian philosopher who tragically ended his life in 1903, shortly after completing a 500-page treatise on male-female relations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Incel Syndrome is an interactive visual novel. The player is able to freely explore two timelines: the PRESENT, which documents Sam's current interactions and activities; and the PAST, a manifesto-style account of his life until the present day. At the end of the game both timelines converge in an unprecedented display of phantasmagoric apotheosis.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Progress: [Space]<br></li><li>Enter/Exit Menu: [Esc]<br></li><li>Select choice: [Mouse]<br></li><li>Full Screen: [Alt] + [Enter]</li></ul><br>Produced by S.O.C.A.H<br>Written by LAN","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730890554","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730890554","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512470/18202652c724abd23e1161e50b5b868a7a51f83f/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730890554","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1512470/18202652c724abd23e1161e50b5b868a7a51f83f/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730890554","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,2,5],"notes":"This game contains verbal descriptions of sensitive subjects, including alcohol and drug use, violence and human sexuality.\r\n\r\nThis game contains language that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive by some players.\r\n\r\nThis game contains references to views and ideologies that may be considered offensive or objectionable by some players.
