{"about_the_game":"The Cursed House series is the trickiest Match3 Puzzle game out there, and this one is no exception. As usual, there are some new twists in the game mechanics, a fresh set of levels, and some of them are quite challenging, even seemingly impassable at first glance. But don't worry; if you can't figure out what to do, there's an interactive HINT button (we're continuously improving its functionality with each project, making it more accurate and interactive), so you won't get stuck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd of course, there are some bonus games included, such as Spot the Difference, Hidden Objects, Solitaire, and Sokoban. Plus, there's a town to unspell.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can play in Timed, Relaxed, or Limited Moves modes. Additionally, you can replay levels you enjoy, or skip all the bonus games and come back to them later if you prefer.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709799367","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1709799367","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709799367","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2829470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709799367","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Cursed House series is the trickiest Match3 Puzzle game out there, and this one is no exception.
