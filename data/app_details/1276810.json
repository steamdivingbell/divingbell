Most people go to the afterlife after dying, yet those who were unhappy with their previous lives become ghosts and are forced to haunt the Earth until they right their wrongs. Of course, this is not always possible since doing this as a ghost is orders of magnitude harder than when you are a human. However, some manage to do this and are able to spend the rest of their deaths in the afterlife. In The Outbound Ghost, your task is to help others fix or come to terms with their past lives so that they can enjoy the pleasures of eternal bliss. You must achieve that for yourself too, but it's not so easy to mend the mistakes of your past life when you don't even remember them.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Finish Chapter 1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/bb000edfed35b0199eabaa870f7557ba2f851e5b.jpg"},{"name":"Finish Chapter 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/823033308094b921f1a76694c950eade7cbc18ae.jpg"},{"name":"Finish Chapter 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/c8be71fe699769fa51ff15a44440a6ed50b1a1b3.jpg"},{"name":"Start Chapter 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/9ef677e4bc4518d3c2021e33c5a4b130d67fd89d.jpg"},{"name":"Obtain a Hidden Figment","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/2ab24ac357381ab4da56953d4c31d4f29d8dbafa.jpg"},{"name":"Get a Full Party of 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/00109b127fb5e8ceaf4aa8c1708945fcff02e668.jpg"},{"name":"Start a Save File With Special Settings","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/99b5dc6c8d81d4a43ef506841dcf1db5e9e33ba9.jpg"},{"name":"Obtain 4 Hidden Figments","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/fb1385ef46622486bee78ca85ef13851a4e56f03.jpg"},{"name":"Obtain 10 Hidden Figments","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/ac1be88e1abca8936eecbe867319d45f8ea870b5.jpg"},{"name":"Forge an Aspect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1276810/4b9b73c2402fc214d5a04431507a2a12e3eb9224.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729344983","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276810/page.bg.jpg?t=1729344983","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729344983","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729344983","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1689380,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Join us on Discord</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1276810/extras/thegame.png?t=1729344983\" /><br><strong>The Outbound Ghost</strong> is an adventure RPG about helping ghosts ascend to the afterlife.
