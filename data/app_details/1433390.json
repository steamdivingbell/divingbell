{"about_the_game":"To My Best Friend is a short, personal narrative experience without traditional game mechanics or challenge. You follow the story of Bailey, a girl growing up in a small American town who forms an amazing friendship with her best friend, Charlie. You'll experience the nostalgia of youth and the challenge of growing over the course of this narrative. You'll find many surprises as the world of childhood imagination and reality blend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a full voice over cast, an original score, and a story leaving you with food for thought, this narrative has a great amount of heart put into it. We hope you enjoy.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The First Moment","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/1ed9bbaa2cc1c1b06421b1dac5ce533fb6eaacd0.jpg"},{"name":"The Adventurous Duo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/6c394b96b8dc40d21c87b365bb80050bfb4670fa.jpg"},{"name":"Roll Initiative","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/4bd235143a867e2f61fb1010f34b2d4ccb4068ac.jpg"},{"name":"The Prom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/d54e3813fad0ebd4980048315e16b1f8e2662b24.jpg"},{"name":"Night Lights","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/651482cf590d7303c3baecd0355efce9b87518d9.jpg"},{"name":"Your Best Friend","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/a401c447a1164dce997061d3099407827f09975a.jpg"},{"name":"Bailey\u2019s Memories","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/eb2a7b0e9eb52b0fb77318a17b8de0a683e0a3f6.jpg"},{"name":"The Hallway of Doors","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/b42d45f632ea4591a69a5a84d0caee9bce5ed0f7.jpg"},{"name":"The Secret Sticker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433390/3bd2b011922574b72cc1e1ebb9503ef2424a6ca9.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1433390?t=1607661629","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1433390?t=1607661629","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433390/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1607661629","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433390/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1607661629","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"To My Best Friend contains a brief and mild sexual reference in-line with immature teenage thoughts of a character."},"detailed_description":"To My Best Friend is a short, personal narrative experience without traditional game mechanics or challenge.
