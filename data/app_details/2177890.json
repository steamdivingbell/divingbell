{"about_the_game":"God Machines is a turn-based tactical RPG with roguelike features where you play as a sentient AI fighting for survival in a hostile post-nuclear world. Control a squad of Combatants through a Brainlink interface to gather resources and rebuild the GRID infrastructure to expand your reach. Improve your Combatants by enhancing their flesh or replacing it with augmentations. Decide the fate of those who fall under your dominion. It is up to you if you annihilate or enslave them, but remember that in a world corrupted by life, decisions are driven by emotions, deception is lurking everywhere, and only the most ruthless will thrive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2177890/extras/Header_EN_CustomizableCombatants.png?t=1717150352\" /></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2177890/extras/GIF_CombatantAssembly.gif?t=1717150352\" /><br>Use the Assembler to meld three species: Humans, Synths, and Machines into unique and fully customizable Combatants. Each combatant starts with Instructions that provide basic controls like movement and melee attacks. Equip them with weapon modules to unlock new Instructions. Every Combatant has two slots for Mods that alter the mechanics of equipped Instructions. Experiment with different approaches and learn your enemy's preferences and weaknesses to exploit them effectively.
