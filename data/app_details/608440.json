{"about_the_game":"Volatile Triangle combines the best aspects of many genres to produce something truly unique. Hardcore puzzle platforming coupled with a trajectory based movement system means the main challenge is simply collecting all of the orbs and getting through the portal without dying. The added challenge of getting a perfect score using the least amount of moves possible will keep you busy for a long time. Getting a perfect score will not be easy to achieve and will take an absolute understanding of the game.
