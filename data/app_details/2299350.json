{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Society Scenario #3-15: Cavern of the Sundered Song<br> <br> A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 9-12. <br> The scrollmaster Effeflinn Whyst is never seen outside the libraries of the Pathfinder Society's Grand Lodge. She speaks only in ancient songs and rhymes, and some claim that she has memorized every book in the archives. Kreighton Shaine, the enigmatic Master of Scrolls, avoids her at all costs. The two elves clearly share some history, but no one has ever learned their story. <br> When Effeflinn suddenly rushes through a portal in the Grand Lodge, and Kreighton goes in after her, the Society organizes an expedition into the mysterious and deadly caverns on the other side of the portal. Where have the scrollmasters gone? What secrets have they kept, and why? The Society is going to need its best agents to face the dangers and solve the mysteries in the Cavern of the Sundered Song. <br> Written by Kate Baker <br> <br><strong> Scenario tags:</strong> Glyph, Faction (Grand Archive) <br>  This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
