{"about_the_game":"In the game &quot;FIRST MEN\u00b4S LIFE&quot; you wake up on a beautiful open world map in the middle of nowhere. It's practically a matter of surviving yourself. You can create your own house with the integrated building system. Eating is of course also important, which is why you also have to take care of foods such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish. There are also opponents in the game who can pose a real challenge.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805750/extras/Gameplay.png?t=1708682818\" /><br><br>In &quot;FIRST MEN\u00b4S LIFE&quot; you start with a stone in your hand. The first thing you have to do is find something to eat so that you don't lose hearts. Once you have done that, you should cut down the first trees in order to be well prepared for the first night. After the first night, you can go on a discovery tour. You discover new biomes, forests, lakes and much more. After a certain time you will meet the first opponents who only want evil. So that you can defeat them, you should be well armed in advance.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805750/extras/Features.png?t=1708682818\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What FIRST MEN\u00b4S LIFE offers</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> try to survive- Build your own things<br></li><li> Produce and cook food yourself<br></li><li> many unlockable game objects<br></li><li> Eliminate opponents<br></li><li> Diversity of biomes<br></li><li> Breathtaking graphics</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What FIRST MEN\u00b4S LIFE <strong>doesn't</strong> offer</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Multiplayer<br></li><li> Creative Mode<br></li><li> Serious violence<br></li><li> trade</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1805750/extras/Developer.png?t=1708682818\" /><br><br>FIRST MEN'S LIFE is developed by a pupil from Hamburg.
