{"about_the_game":"Vertical Slice: A Game Dev Story is a life simulation and management game that invites you to experience the life of a game developer: <strong>start from scratch as a one-man studio and take off from there to become a successful game producer</strong> in a 3 years-long journey!<br><br><strong>Experience the trials and tribulations of this hard job </strong>on your own and, also, supervising a small team where everyone counts on your organization and leadership skills. Work hard every day to develop a successful game that catapults you to the stardom of games in a reasonable time.<br><br>As the leader of your studio (sometimes caricatured as a talking cat) <strong>you have to organize its members\u2019 work \u2013 but also care about your own welfare.</strong> It\u2019s easy to forget the world when you\u2019re developing a game, so make sure your developer eats, sleeps, exercises his body and has fun, so his physical and mental health doesn\u2019t suffer.<br><br>But even when you\u2019re living the dream of being a game developer, there\u2019s more to life than work: you\u2019ll meet people while hanging around, and it will be up to you if you work on your personal skills to be likable enough, and if you want to dig deeper into their lives and stories. <strong>You decide what kind of game producer you want to be in this slice-of-life story!</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Take decisions in game development.</strong> What art style fits your vision better for the game?
