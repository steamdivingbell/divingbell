Dust off your jetpack, grab your dynamite, and prepare your laser eyes to dive deep into Klaus' first challenging adventure! <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1776700/extras/KL_RetroClassic2.png?t=1731055278\" /><br>You remember Klaus Lee, right?!  No? Well, you should!  He almost became a cop in Beverly Hills but then applied to be a private investigator in Hawaii and got bored waiting to find out if he got it. Moving back to Cali, he worked as an unknown stuntman while running a squad of troubleshooters that kept getting beaten to the clients by A much more successful Team. One time he barely missed his job interview at a New York startup and some dude named Zeddemore got the job as an exterminator of spirits. <br>Did you know that Klaus trained Maverick how to both fly his jet and play killer beach volleyball? This is only a glimpse of everything he experienced living life to the max. Klaus was a really busy guy!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1776700/extras/KL_Spelunkin2.png?t=1731055278\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1776700/extras/spelunking2.gif?t=1731055278\" /> <br>This is the first chapter of the famous action hero Klaus Lee. He was the role model for Colt Seavers, he made Chuck Norris walk as a toddler and prepared some water for Bruce Lee. He dated all Charlie's Angels at the same time in the same restaurant at different tables and he taught Steve McQueen how to drive a car.
