{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br>    <br> <br>    <br>Starfinder RPG - Starfinder Adventure Path #45: The Culling Shadow (Horizons of the Vast 6 of 6)<br> <br> A fleet of warships invades the Weydana system, and the PCs must launch their own armada to withstand the attack! When Watcher Krulveth, the leader of the invading forces, wishes to speak to the PCs in person, they must decide whether to meet her in good faith or expect an ambush. But stopping Krulveth and her armada doesn't mean the system is completely safe.
