It is, in essence, a book. However there are real time 3D graphics running in the background, and relaxing music to listen to as you read. The graphics are configurable for both high-end and low-end machines, and you can hide the text and just watch the experience as a looping benchmark. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPress Alt + Enter for Full Screen mode. <br />\r\nPress Space to Toggle Text. <br />\r\nPress Escape to Access Options.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1918260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1646762009","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1918260/page.bg.jpg?t=1646762009","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1918260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646762009","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1918260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646762009","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The World is Binary, a 3D visual novel, takes you on a journey of good and evil, science and religion, and questions what is true or false.
