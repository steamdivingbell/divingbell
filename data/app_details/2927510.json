Whether you're a speedrunner, completionist, or just here for casual platforming fun, there are many ways to play and enjoy this series of digital obstacle courses! Beat the best times of levels to get better keys and unlock secrets, save or ignore every data to receive awards or face stronger foes, and you can do it all without taking a tick of damage! The real challenge starts when you chose to perfect your runs and do every challenge the game has to offer. Though, if that's not your thing, just getting to the end is fine too!
