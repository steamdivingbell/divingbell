{"about_the_game":"Two cars that left their mark on an era in a booster pack. The Lancia 037 was a legendary Group B car in the 1980s. It was the last rear-wheel drive to win the World Rally Championship. With a 4-cylinder 205hp engine, it offers a unique driving experience and is difficult to tame. As for the Porsche 911 GT3 RS RGT, it is a monster of power and technology. Thanks to its flat-six 500hp engine and unmistakable sound, there are no other cars quite like it.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1599551953","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1599551953","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1599551953","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1101810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1599551953","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Two cars that left their mark on an era in a booster pack.
