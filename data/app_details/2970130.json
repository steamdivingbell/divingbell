Navigate the vast Cumberland Yard on complex switching duties, and do battle with nail-biting grades, all in Train Sim World\u00ae: Sand Patch Grade.<br><br>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio built Sand Patch Grade, opening the east-west route over the rugged Allegheny Mountains in the early 1870s. To lift the B&amp;O\u2019s endless armada of heavy trains over the rugged spine of the Alleghenies, Sand Patch Grade climbed from Cumberland, Maryland at an elevation of 627 feet above sea level to the line\u2019s summit at Sand Patch, Pennsylvania and a rail elevation of 2,258 feet. From the Sand Patch summit, then the line began a descent toward Rockwood, Pennsylvania (elevation 1,837 feet).<br><br>CSX tonnage traffic on Sand Patch is heavy, frequent, and diverse. Railroad giants such as the AC4400CW haul everything from coal, grain, oil, autos and intermodal traffic. Modern units are supported by the veteran SD40-2, offering their power on mountain-climbing duties. Meanwhile, the classic GP38-2 keeps busy in Cumberland Yard, sorting cars and preparing trains for onward delivery.<br><br>Choose how you want to play; operate trains, ride around as a conductor, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold.
