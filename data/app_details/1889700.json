{"about_the_game":"Archrebel is a sci-fi turn-based strategy war game, strongly inspired by the classic Rebelstar released back in 1986.

By gathering followers, looting, purchasing, and capturing powerful droids, the player will eventually assemble a force to repel the intruder that took control of the planet's colonies in secrecy.<br><br><strong><u>Types of missions:</u></strong><br>Some of the game's missions objectives include eliminating hostile forces, escaping, destroying, exploring, capturing bases or equipment, and even contacting the orbital trading centers to send in dropships for resupply and rush to get them before enemies do.
