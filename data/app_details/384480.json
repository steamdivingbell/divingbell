Each level will bring the threats to a whole new level, adding all kinds of sci-fi hazards: from portals to laser beams.<br>You will need to carefully analyze each cubic planet to understand its dangers and potential solutions. Rushing might lead you to death: it\u2019s all about breaking down each puzzle and finding the right pace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE A VAST GALAXY SYSTEM</h2>Six Sides of the World presents you a series of star systems to be explored. Each one is comprised by different puzzles that introduce new and more challenging mechanics. But most interesting feature of this is that these star systems can be navigated linearly, following a easier predetermined path; or you can make a detour if you are brave enough. Some of the puzzles will present more than one possible solution, enabling the player to achieve a more difficult victory, that will unlock new extra puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FROM TEST OF WIT TO ULTIMATE HEADACHE!</h2>The freedom of exploration in Six Sides of the World let you set the difficulty: the linear path takes an intelligent and resolutive mind; but the additional solutions to some of the puzzles require a true sense of understanding of each puzzle. And that\u2019s not all! These solutions will lead you to extra puzzles that are capable of driving you insane. It is a smart way of letting the player to set the difficulty by him/herself: going for the extra solution is a way of asking for bigger challenges. And the extra levels are the biggest challenges you can face! There is a difference between understanding new mechanics and getting to their true core. Are you ready?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ALL HAIL THE PUZZLE LORD!</h2>Maigo is an explorer who\u2019s about to discover something far bigger than he expects.

What motivates this intergalactic architect? There\u2019s an utter plan beyond all this? It is a test? A mean to protect something?
