{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 018 - July 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Unearthly Weapons</strong> by Ben McFarland with art from Nick De Spain. Awesome characters need similarly awesome weapons--and better yet, most of these magic weapons can be any type of weapon or can take any form the wielder desires, with dazzling visual effects every time you parry a blow or score a critical hit. Each weapon also includes history and lore that could inspire a new subplot or a whole campaign arc! <br> <br><strong> Appendix NPC: Part 1</strong> by Sam Mannell with art from Patrik Hell. Are you tired of using the basic acolyte, cultist, guard, and knight stat blocks over and over again, or spending two hours making just the right stat block for your favorite NPC even though they might not show up in combat? Part 1 of the &quot;Appendix NPC&quot; comes to the rescue with fourteen new Humanoid stat blocks that you can use or tweak to suit your needs, including the arcane student, the troubadour-warrior, and the bodyguard. <br> <br><strong> Puzzles of Permanence</strong> by Rachael Cruz with art from Matheus Graef (via Conceptopolis). Spice up your next dungeon with a courtyard of petrified adventurers, a massive gyroscopic puzzle ball, or a cursed sphinx! This article contains three drop-in puzzle encounters that challenge your players (with plenty of hints if they get stuck) and grant them uniquely valuable rewards. &quot;","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2452990?t=1687267602","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2452990?t=1687267602","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2452990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687267602","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2452990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687267602","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 018 - July 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
