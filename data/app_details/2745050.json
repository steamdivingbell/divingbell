{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automate</h2>In Flow Factory you will mine for raw materials and build a factory. You will process materials into higher quality materials. Manage energy and resources wisely to keep your factory running.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tinker</h2>Think about the best way to combine different materials. You can merge your materials, grip, transport, rotate, duplicate, reshape, melt, blast, sort, distribute, accelerate them. Be creative, experiment and see what works.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Physics-based</h2>All resources float freely. You can grab and move them anywhere. Be clever with your logistics to avoid parts falling off. You will have to make smart use of gravity. By the way, you can reverse gravity as well.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create the flow</h2>.&quot;It works!&quot; It's not just you who is going to be in flow state and forget about time. Make sure your materials are also in flow. Get them whizzing down conveyors and through your machines. Release blockages. It's a wonderful feeling when your complex, sophisticated production chains run smoothly. Just sit back and enjoy the flow!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Optimize</h2>&quot;Wait, you can do even better!&quot; Keep optimizing your production chains and processes. Produce more, faster, and more efficiently. Also, research new technologies and upgrades.<br><br>All of this is in service of your important space mission. You have landed on an asteroid. Your goal is to build and activate the giant laser. Then you could send the energy produced by your factory back home and save the planet!<br><br>Easy to learn - hard to master. There are no opponents and therefore little stress, but you have to be careful that your factory doesn't blow up in your face.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 120 and more technologies to research<br></li><li> 30 and more different machines to try out<br></li><li> 20 and more recipes to craft<br></li><li> 7 different materials to discover<br></li><li> 5 different types of soil<br></li><li> 1 developer - solo-developed<br></li><li> 0 opponents and yet challenging</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2745050?t=1726595961","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2745050?t=1726595961","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726595961","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726595961","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automate</h2>In Flow Factory you will mine for raw materials and build a factory.
