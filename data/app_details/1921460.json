{"about_the_game":"Zap Dem Rats is a Third Person Shooter game of skill where the player helps Mr. Prez overcome his many adversaries to regain the Whitehouse. High score wins. <br />\r\nThere is plenty of humorous dialogue as Mr. Prez traverses the city scape, and there is no blood or guts or deaths from the red ray and blue ray guns.<br />\r\nMr. Prez narrates the tutorial explaining blue and red ray gun function, zapping of signs and the reward for delay zapping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Prez must dodge the illogic bombs tossed at him by the Zombies, and when his mental health reaches 5%, his smoking hot White Guardian Angel transports him to a stunning Red Angel at Tommy\u2019s Garage where she rejuvenates, and then returns him to the fray.  <br />\r\nIn our first scene, Mr. Prez fixes rigged voting machines, transforms zombie voters into good Republican voters or zaps them over to socialistic Venezuela and installs an audit team to correct the crooked vote counting procedures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur second scene is all about the fake media, rebranding the big six, stopping the broadcasting of fake media that damages your brain, changing the stupid lies of the media celebrities with the truth, and exposing the biased editorial staffs of two popular magazines.  Of course, Zombies continue with their illogic bombardment activities and are transformed or sent to Venezuela. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third scene is about your second amendment. It has a medical plaza perpetrating and exaggerating the pandemic, followed by Stalin and Hitler\u2019s support of gun confiscation. You run a maze where five Senators expose their gun confiscation plans, and then you meet the 10 Representatives who have scary anti-gun legislation. Finally, you enter the Confiscation Depot where symbolically American guns packed in wooded crates are ready for destruction and Mr. Prez saves them with a magic force field and secures them with a stout fence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are accepting player design suggestions for completion of WOKE U, a partially completed scene with a football stadium and lecture halls on opening day with curriculum sign-ups.   It is all about the stupid leftist indoctrination of our students at radicalized universities. ANTIFA, Pro-Nouns, multiple genders, what WOKE means and what they want, and even Russian aggression is targeted. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur last scene pits Speaker of the House Nanci Haglosi and her dangerous Demi-Hornets against Mr. Prez in his final approach to the Whitehouse. There are waves of hornets each with the face of Haglosi culminating in a final wave of elite hornets which fly faster and have more powerful stings. Once all hornets are vaporized with the blue ray gun, Mr. Prez can proceed past the roadblock leading to the Whitehouse. There, cheering crowds greet Mr. Prez who gives a triumphant welcome home speech and the game ends.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Prez wins by returning to the Whitehouse, and a high score is a win for the player. Player navigation and aiming skills are important to gain high point scores. Easy to play, harder to master.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"It's great to be back!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1921460/1d63fdd34a4799641d65d5a2163841a56137edad.jpg"},{"name":"Vote Today","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1921460/85ef5e7f9c5069951a3686b83b97983c40ce9a71.jpg"},{"name":"Capitol","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1921460/4b8c7aa0d47f2a62bff3d7ff8191aa25d08d14d8.jpg"},{"name":"Media City","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1921460/4ffdba37b1fabd38c413687893dbce5a08aeab20.jpg"},{"name":"2A Gun Depot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1921460/682a15fb5769d4203c3c0270878f32f1383b72c5.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1921460/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1681597774","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1921460/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1681597774","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1921460/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1681597774","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1921460/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1681597774","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"General zapping of zombies"},"detailed_description":"Zap Dem Rats is a Third Person Shooter game of skill where the player helps Mr. Prez overcome his many adversaries to regain the Whitehouse.
