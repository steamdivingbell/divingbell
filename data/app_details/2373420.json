From age to age sound witches and shadowcatchers have therefore ventured out into the dark to wake up and steal from the Nightrider's dangerous realm.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>This demo let's you experience a totally new form of interactive music. The rhythmic gameplay is challenging by design and best played with a game controller (keyboard/mouse control is supported too). While the final gameplay of THE SONG OF THE NIGHTRIDER will combine your SHADOWCATCHING talents with delicate fencing skills, the power of battle music and the use of game items like sound traps, this gameplay demo deliberately focuses on its acoustic potential. Therefore the noise level display and the threat of discovery by the Nightrider remain deactivated.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEMO</h2>This demo includes one stage with three increasing difficulty levels (mist/rain/snow). Each level requires more musical attention than the last one till you attain the skills of a true sound witch and have reached the actual game difficulty. So be warned: Your cute opponent may become frustrating deadly if you don't learn to trust your ears and head the hints in the sound design as well as the few tutorial instructions.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2373420/extras/2_Hiding.png?t=1680765068\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TECHNICAL NOTES</h2>To play this acoustic gameplay demo (developed exclusively for PC) we recommend sufficient gaming performance. Otherwise, the implemented rhythmic control system may not run smoothly and the gameplay experience suffer greatly. So please check system requirements carefully before downloading the demo.
