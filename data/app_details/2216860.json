{"about_the_game":"Become the conscience of a psychopathic serial killer in the most bizarre point&amp;click adventure ever created.<br><br>Players follow the linear story of protagonist Anthony. On the edge of his humanity, he struggles between his inner and real worlds. Through fragments of memories and traumas, you witness horrific acts of murder and torture and many expressive situations. A bizarre 5-6 hours of surreal journey through the subconscious, inner demons and the bitter reality of the world awaits you.<br><br>Player experiences a very atmospheric, almost distressful experience of a character hurting not only himself but also other innocent characters throughout the game with his lust and sense of pleasure. However the game does not put the player in a classical position, but rather guides him through the whole spectrum of a interactive movie, from which he becomes a spectator and a player in parallel. The more you free the limited will of the main character, the more the game interaction becomes available.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2216860/extras/dotextupics_3.jpg?t=1708369715\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Decision.
