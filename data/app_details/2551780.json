Your job is to spot and report any anomalies that occur in the house, such as moving objects, disappearing items, electrical glitches, camera errors, and much more. But be careful, the anomalies are not only watching you, but they are also trying to stop you from reporting them. Most of them are likely harmless, but some of them are much more dangerous.<br><br>You currently oversee two different houses, and there are some oddities strewn around. They have mysterious and dark histories, with secrets that you might uncover as you play. Why are these homes such a playground for paranormal activity?<br><br>Using Unity 2023 and its bleeding-edge realtime dynamic lighting system, the anomalies are more striking, scary and dynamic than ever before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>18 different types of anomalies (with more planned!)<br></li><li> 2 Distinct locations with unique gameplay, with more in development<br></li><li>A dynamic lighting system<br></li><li>Over 300 different anomalies<br></li><li>Game and Challenge modes that change the difficulty and the style of the game: normal mode, dark mode, black and white mode, or hard mode<br></li><li>Mix &amp; Match game modes for varied and thrilling challenges!<br></li><li>Clous saving, stat tracking and achievements<br></li><li>Future updates planned (Neighbourhood Watch, new levels, seasonal content, content updates &amp; more!)</li></ul><br>Midnight Monitor: Anomaly Watch is a game that will test your observation skills, your memory, and your nerves.
