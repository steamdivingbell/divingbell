While their deaths can be brutal and violent, the game does not feature grotesque gore or dismemberment. The violent scenes are suggestive and serve the story, without aiming to shock or provoke excessively. It is important to note that players may encounter moments of tension and emotional distress that contribute to the dark and oppressive atmosphere of the game. However, no explicitly shocking content such as sexual assaults, alcohol or drug abuse, or self-harm is present. We advise players sensitive to such content to consider this approach before embarking on the adventure."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>\u201cTwo children are confronted with the harsh reality of the place they have just arrived in.
