This means that you <strong>won't</strong> need to port forward, and also means that the game isn't reliant on a matchmaking server. But it also might not work at all in some circumstances. It will work best on home modems, but may not work on large wifi networks with extenders. In this case, you'll either have to port forward, use a VLAN service, or use steam remote play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Seamless binging experience</h2>Settings and recently connected players will be remembered across all the games in the series, so you won't need to keep entering IP addresses unless they've changed.
