{"about_the_game":"The Victorian Railways K class was one of the most successful classes of locomotive built for the Victorian Railways, built in several batches in 1922/23 (for the first series), and 1940-1946 for later versions, resulting in a class of 53 with a few variations. These versatile 2-8-0 Consolidation locomotives were designed for use on the light branchlines in Victoria, but saw use in all sorts of service, from branchline freight, mixed and passenger trains, through to mainline roadside goods service, yard shunters, and some mainline passenger use. This class saw use until the end of steam on the Victorian Railways and beyond, with K162 operating as the North Ballarat workshops pilot (shunter) until 1979. Now there are 4 currently preserved operational (3 on the mainline), these being K153, K183 and K190 with Steamrail Victoria, K163 at Mornington Railway, plus K160 under overhaul/restoration for the Victorian Goldfields Railway and many others statically preserved, stored, or under restoration around the state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack features 4th series K class (single cab window, and boxpok wheels), K190, as preserved between 1979 and 1993 in 2 tone green with yellow lining in 4 variants to cover changes to the livery and details on the loco and tender over this period.
