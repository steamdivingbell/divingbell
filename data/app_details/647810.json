{"about_the_game":"VertoStudio VR is a fully-capable 3D modeling studio designed to run entirely in VR!  No mirroring or external software is required of any kind. You can use it to import FBX, OBJ, DAE (and more) directly in front of you, then configure every aspect of the visual display of these scenes directly down to the individual polygons.
