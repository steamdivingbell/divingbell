Also compatible with equivalent AUX to USB3 adapters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAMERA SETUP</strong></h2><br>Before you can use the tracker, you will need to calibrate the camera. Please refer to the 'README' in the 'steamapps\\common\\iVRy\\data' folder of your Steam installation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>PSMOVE SETUP</strong></h2><br>PSMove controllers must be paired to your computer before they will be recognised. To pair PSMove controllers, use the 'psmove' utility, found in the 'steamapps\\common\\iVRy\\bin\\win64' folder of your Steam installation. You will need to open an Administator command prompt to use it. Pairing requires Bluetooth 4.0+, and may not work with all BT controllers. A known working controller is the ASUS BT400 USB dongle.<br><br>Pairing with 'psmove' is described here:<br><br><br><br>If you are using the original (PS3) PSMove controllers (model ZMC1), then you will need to perform an additional calibration step to calibrate the magnetometer, using the following command after pairing:<br><br>psmove calibrate <br><br>PSMove controllers use the same mappings as PSMoveSteamVRBridge. It is not necessary to install PSMoveService or PSMoveServiceSteamVRBridge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NOTE:</strong></h2><br>The Monado tracker for iVRy is experimental software.
