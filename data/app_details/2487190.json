{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You have been sent out to the frontier of human-charted space in a small mining ship, tasked with expanding humanity's footprint amongst the stars.

Build machines, connect them with conveyor belts, and plan out your production lines in order to make sure everything is running at maximum efficiency.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Expand Your Base</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Space stations are the center of your logistic network. Decide whether to build a massive base of operations, or distribute your production between multiple stations and manage transporting items between them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Command a Fleet</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Ships form the backbone of your transportation network and your defences.
