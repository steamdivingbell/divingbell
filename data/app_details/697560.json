Twelve of your favorite oozes are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every globbulent horror has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from an mythic id ooze\u2019s psychotropic vapors to a mythic carnivorous blob\u2019s skeletal liquefaction.</i><br><br>This product includes mythic oozes of commonplace varieties like the black pudding and gelatinous cube, as well as variants like the electric jelly and white pudding, made far more distinct in their mythic evolutions, covering CRs from 4 to 16. In addition to a dozen familiar oozy monsters, Mythic Monsters: Oozes also includes suggested alternate rules for dealing with some common ooze abilities as they interact with the mythic rules and mythic characters. To top it all off, Mythic Monsters: Oozes introduces an entirely new 13th mythic ooze, the swift and deadly quicksilver ooze, congealed from the divine forges of the gods themselves.<br><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they\u2019ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do.
