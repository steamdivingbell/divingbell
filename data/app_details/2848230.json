{"about_the_game":"Two Sides is a unique sandbox where you explore the duality of choices. Play as a savior or a sinner, navigating through complex scenarios that challenge your morality. You create your own story. This isn't a game about good vs evil, your choices have consequences and there's no clear path to achieving your objective without any side effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Simulated sandbox environment with NPCs that respond to your actions.<br />\r\n- Consequences where any character can become a witness to your action.<br />\r\n- Realistic physics &amp; gunplay.<br />\r\n- Infinite replayability through randomized levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery action you take affects how the level can play out. Are you going to shoot an innocent just because they saw you break the law so you don't get caught? Or are you going to shooting someone accidentally just to get to an objective faster?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo Sides is a top down tactical shooter where you navigate a detailed sandbox full of interactions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you prepared to make tough choices? Will you risk people's lives to conceal your mistakes, or will you take the difficult path to preserve your morality? In Two Sides you can choose how you want to approach things.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2848230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723413742","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2848230/page.bg.jpg?t=1723413742","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2848230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723413742","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2848230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723413742","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Two Sides is a unique sandbox where you explore the duality of choices.
