A once peaceful and harmonious realm, thrown into chaos by a coup d'etat lead by a traitorous royal guard, Typherius. Rivers of blood flowed through the streets of cities who would not bend the knee, who would not denounce the Eternals and burn any knowledge of Eternia. Many paid the ultimate price in the years to come until Ancient Ones flooded the eastern lands of Elemore, halting the bloody crusade led by Typherius and refocusing humanities efforts on survival. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Visceral Combat</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1840410/extras/TrailerTest.gif?t=1730666904\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by the soulslike genre, experience a visceral combo-based combat system that is easy to learn, but hard to master.
