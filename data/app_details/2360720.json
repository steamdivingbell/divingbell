In Bug &amp; Seek, you've just sunk your life savings into buying an abandoned Insectarium (bug zoo)! Once the lifeblood of the town and its economy, someone stole all the bugs in the dead of night. Now it's up to you to catch and sell bugs that make jokes, fulfill requests from the local shops, and re-establish the Insectarium as a town icon. <strong>Become a master bug hunter</strong> as you level up your bug-catching skills, upgrade your equipment, and expand your Insectarium. Meet the locals and complete quests to earn special items and discover what really happened during The Great Bug Heist. And relax! There are no wrong choices, no energy levels to worry about, and plenty of time to complete quests and jobs.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2360720/extras/HeadingFeatures.png?t=1729003068\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Catch Bugs</strong> -- With up to 220 different real-life bugs, ranging from common insects to some of the most rare and valuable insects in the world, the possibilities are endless.
