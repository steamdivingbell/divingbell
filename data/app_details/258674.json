{"about_the_game":"Become King of the railway with the new N15 King Arthur Class for Train Simulator, recreating the only preserved locomotive in the Class, \u2018Sir Lamiel\u2019.<br><br>The N15 Class was born from a need of the London &amp; South Western Railway for more powerful express passenger locomotives that could cope with increasing train loads on the long and arduous West Country routes of the UK. The result was the N15 class design, completed by the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the L&amp;SWR, Robert W Urie.<br><br>A total of 74 \u2018King Arthurs\u2019 were built between 1919 and 1926, although during this time the design was changed when the Southern Railway absorbed the L&amp;SWR during \u2018grouping\u2019. Later batches of the Class were built by different works and with updated designs to make them more efficient and streamlined.<br><br>Early versions of the N15 Class were named after the Knights of the Round Table, hence their \u2018King Arthur\u2019 nickname, a tag that set them apart from other express steam locomotives of the time.<br><br>Withdrawal of the class began in 1953 with the last locomotive retired from service in 1962.
