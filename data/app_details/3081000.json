{"about_the_game":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to find yourself in the wilderness with no tools or resources? In this PvE sandbox game, you'll need to utilize nature, bushcraft and prepare for the challenges ahead. <br><br>The story starts when you find yourself stranded on a deserted island after being betrayed by an accomplice. With no one searching for you, you'll need to establish a base, gather gear, and keep yourself fed and hydrated while preparing for the colder seasons. Fire is your lifeline, and you must protect both yourself and your fire from the harsh elements. Every decision matters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CRAFTING</h2> With no modern tools at your disposal, everything must be crafted from natural resources. Craft primitive tools, create materials, and make clothing to survive. While advanced tools require more steps to craft, they provide a significant advantage in survival. As you level up, crafting becomes faster and more efficient.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BASE BUILDING</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081000/extras/buildingGif.gif?t=1734903017\" /><br>In order to build something you need a levelled ground. Start by establishing a simple shelter for your base. Later on build sturdy primitive structures to protect from harsh weather.

As autumn arrives, temperatures start to drop, but resources remain relatively plentiful. Winter brings harsh cold and scarcity, making survival far more challenging as food and materials become harder to find. In spring, the weather starts to warm, but resources are still limited, requiring careful planning to make it through until the next summer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FOOD</h2> <img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081000/extras/foodScavange2.gif?t=1734903017\" /><br>Effective food management is crucial for survival, especially on a deserted island. Forage for vegetables in the forests and cultivate seeds for higher yields. Use traps and snares for passive hunting, and set up a fishtrap to secure vital calories in the early days. With well-trained archery skills, you can hunt animals directly for a more reliable food source.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WOOD</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3081000/extras/TimberWorkGif.gif?t=1734903017\" /><br>Sticks and twigs can be found all around the map, but timber for structures needs to be cut down.
