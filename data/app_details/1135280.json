The Stranger Things Chapter includes a new map, the Underground Complex, located below the Hawkins National Laboratory. A Demogorgon is the new untamable Killer. Against the Demogorgon stands not one, but two new Survivors: Nancy Wheeler, a tough aspiring journalist, and Steve Harrington, a former high school jock with a knack for finding trouble. The Stranger Things Chapter also features two exclusive cosmetic items: Steve\u2019s Scuffed Rolled Sleeves and Nancy\u2019s Torn Sweatshirt.<br><br>It was the early 1980s, a time of cold war experiments and naive fascination, a time of stranger things. In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, covert experiments were being conducted. When an inter-dimensional gate was accidentally opened at the Hawkins National Laboratory, an army of creatures with long, curved claws and gaping faces that bloom like horrific flowers was unleashed. These creatures were labeled \u201cDemogorgons\u201d by a group of local kids who encountered them. <br><br>Nancy Wheeler\u2019s knack for investigative journalism first emerged when she brought down a secret government organization in Hawkins following the disappearance of her closest friend, Barb.

With the help of his friends Dustin and Robin, Steve is carving out a new identity for himself and learning what true friendship really means.

It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and rips it to pieces, devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving nothing for scavengers. The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion or restraint. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the pure instinct of its insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A perfect hunter, the Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.<br><br><strong>The Demogorgon\u2019s Power: Of the Abyss</strong><br>The Demogorgon impacts the environment close to generators, affects nearby Survivors, and uses Portals to travel quickly. The Demogorgon starts with a limited number of Portals that can spawn on any flat floor or ground.  <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1135280/extras/StrangerThings_Killer_Perks_header.png?t=1699306162\" /><br><br>The Demogorgon comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Surge</h2>Your eerie presence charges the air and interferes with technology.

Each time a generator is fixed, vaulting is blocked for the Survivors close to that generator for a short time. <br><i>\u201cThe specimen seems to able to affect the state of nearby objects, as if they existed in some other form within a dimension alternate to our own.\u201d\u2014 Hawkins National Laboratory</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mindbreaker</h2>Your distressing presence drains and weakens your prey. While repairing a generator, Survivors are afflicted by the Exhaustion Status effect.

When her closest friend, Barb went missing, she did everything she could to unravel the truth and secure justice. A brilliant journalist, she chases stories and follows leads despite the inequality and chauvinism she encounters at the workplace. Pursuing a lead one evening, she fearlessly approaches the Hawkins National Laboratory before suddenly losing consciousness. A moment later she awakens in a strange misty realm with the sound of a familiar roar echoing through the air.<br><br>Nancy Wheeler comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Better Together </h2>You seek justice and uncover the truth no matter what obstacle stands in your way. The aura of the generator being repaired is revealed to other Survivors within range. If the Killer downs a Survivor while you are repairing a generator, the Killer\u2019s and Survivors\u2019 auras are revealed to you briefly. \u2212 <i>\u201cLet\u2019s burn that lab to the ground.\u201d\u2014Nancy Wheeler</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fixated</h2>When you have a goal in mind, there\u2019s no turning back: better to ask forgiveness than permission. You can see your own scratch marks at all time. When your health is full, you can walk faster than normal. \u2212 <i>\u201cI wanna finish what we started. I want to kill it.&quot;\u2014Nancy Wheeler</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inner Strength</h2>You look inward and trust your instincts when you feel lost and alone.

He often acts as a surrogate big brother to a younger boy named Dustin. He even helped him find his slimy inter-dimensional pet Demogorgon, D\u2019Artagnan.  His reputation as a protector grew and he soon became a sort of \u2018babysitter\u2019 for a group of kids in Hawkins with a knack for messing around with strange and dangerous things. His courage is unmatched so that he was even able to fend off a Demogorgon when it threatened his friends. <br>One evening he received a call for assistance from his friend Nancy Wheeler. He drove all the way to the Hawkins National Laboratory to see if she was okay. He searched the area but only found her notebook. Before he realized what was happening, the ground opened up and a swirl of black mist filled his eyes. When he awakened he was in a strange place that seemed familiar but unfamiliar at the same time.<br><br>Steve Harrington comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Babysitter</h2>While you have a reputation for being self-centered, you risk it all to help those in need.  The Survivor you unhook leaves no blood trail or scratch marks for a short amount of time. Also, both you and the Killer can briefly see each other\u2019s aura. \u2212<i>\u201cI promised to keep you shitheads safe, and that\u2019s exactly what I plan on doing.\u201d \u2014Steve Harrington</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Camaraderie</h2>Life has taught you the importance of friendship which has given you strength. If a Survivor comes within range of your hook while you are struggling, the Struggle Phase timer pauses briefly. \u2013 <i>\u201cSo, remember once you get in there\u2026 pretend like you don\u2019t care.

Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.
