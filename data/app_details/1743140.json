Your task is ensuring the safety of the humans kept aboard the spacecraft in suspended animation. Unfortunately, a computer virus of unknown origin, for now known as The Malware, is taking over the ship\u2019s service bots. As a W.O.M.A.N., you are independent of this ship\u2019s internal network, and you operate autonomously, which allows you to fight off this intruding threat. Your only hope of saving the humans in stasis is to repel the rogue robots from that section of the ship, then work your way to the Bridge to reboot the Central Computer, which will theoretically purge The Malware.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Several Arena Levels <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Character Customization <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- A High Score System<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Game Controller Compatibility <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Different Enemy Robot Types<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Alternate Ending State<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Power-Ups and Weapon Pick-Ups<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- A Sci-Fi Themed Narrative <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Quick-to-Play Design","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1645467401","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743140/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1645467401","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1645467401","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1743140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1645467401","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"I, W.O.M.A.N. is a Twin-Stick Arena Shooter with a Sci-Fi theme and story.
