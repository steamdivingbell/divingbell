{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Chair Force is an RTT (Real-Time Tactics) game in which you secure dominance on the battlefield by eliminating enemy threats through multifaceted strategic decisions and mission execution. Set against the backdrop of a fictional Second Korean War, players take on the role of an AWACS (Airborne Early Warning and Control) operator, commanding advanced firepower and reconnaissance equipment to control the combat zone. You must employ diverse fire support, cooperate with allied forces, and make precise decisions at critical moments to lead your side to victory.</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3396980/extras/Geumgang_Screenshot.png?t=1734657434\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Modern warfare is a battle of creativity.</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The campaign mode of Chair Force reflects the complexity of modern warfare, allowing for a wide range of tactical approaches.
