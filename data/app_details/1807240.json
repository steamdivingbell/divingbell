This allows you to earn coins - and sometimes gems - to purchase items in your home base in return. Get new weapons, unlock new stages, buy ammo and even pets.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You can do daily quests in order to get useful rewards to earn coins even faster. Each new day you will be rewarded free items that are selected randomly for a day. You can select from three different free items which will then be rewarded to you upon selection.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And if you feel lonely in your home base, you should really buy some pets! Not only are they cute and cuddly (check for a red heart), but they will also poop fortune! Just clean their poop and you will get coins in return. But don't forget to feed your pets or they will not be amused!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\"
