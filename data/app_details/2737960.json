As the hunter Guy, return to find your village under attack by orcs and goblins.

Uncover treasures, explore dungeons, and save the kingdom.

Initially, you embody a hunter facing an army of orcs, a challenge for which his skills are not ideally suited. At the outset, he is not yet shaped into a hero. The game is designed with a learning curve in mind. Utilise health and stamina potions judiciously and upgrade your weapons and armour whenever possible. Take your time, use the camera to zoom out and assess enemy positions, and avoid rushing into large groups of enemies. Saving frequently is also a good thing to do. Rise of the Village Hero features permanent death as well. Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to name your save. Be sure to utilise the quick save function regularly to prevent loss of progress. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2737960/extras/Separator_2_618by200.png?t=1736769979\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Combat:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Combat is straightforward yet engaging, combining melee and ranged attacks with newly introduced abilities.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players have shared how satisfying it feels to take on monsters like orcs, skeletons, and ghosts, all while facing the added challenge of permadeath.
