{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> D&amp;D Curse of Strahd - Syrinscape Sound Link Pack</h2>   <strong> Important Note about Syrinscape Sound Link Packs</strong>   The Sound Link Packs sold in the store are link packs and they do not contain the actual sounds, nor do they grant access to any sounds you do not already own or have the right to play. The requirements for each sound link pack are listed in the product description and most of these will require a Super Syrin subscription with Syrinscape in order to access all the sounds.  Sound link packs are time-saving convenience packs that link content from FGU with content from Syrinscape. You can build these yourself directly in FGU.  <br> Syrinscape Sound Link Packs for Fantasy Grounds work with your Syrinscape Super Syrin subscription to provide you with context-specific sounds for monsters and NPCs in the Curse of Strahd adventure (not included).\u00a0 The collection of Sound Sets can be created for free within the Fantasy Grounds Unity sound interface, but this pack has done all the work for you to link the monsters and story elements as you play the adventure. Appropriate sounds from Syrinscape will show up automatically in your Sound Context Window when you access a reference manual page or open an NPC. <br> This pack includes 327 sound sets separated into the following categories for the D&amp;D Curse of Strahd adventure module (not included): <ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> Reference manual pages </li><li> Important NPCs </li><li> Moods </li><li> Music </li><li> Elements </li><li> SFX </li><li> One-shots </li></ul>  These sound sets contain links to Syrinscape sounds only, and this pack does not grant you access to any sounds you don't already own thru Syrinscape. For the best experience, we recommend subscribing to the Super Syrin or the Dungeons &amp; Dragons subscription at Syrinscape to enable access to all sounds used in this sound link module.\u00a0 &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2488840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689687962","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2488840/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1689687962","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2488840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689687962","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2488840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689687962","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> D&amp;D Curse of Strahd - Syrinscape Sound Link Pack</h2>   <strong> Important Note about Syrinscape Sound Link Packs</strong>   The Sound Link Packs sold in the store are link packs and they do not contain the actual sounds, nor do they grant access to any sounds you do not already own or have the right to play.
