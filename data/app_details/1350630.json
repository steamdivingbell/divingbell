{"about_the_game":"Thanks for stopping by, This game is a short introductory into the American Isekai world that I've created. While not much content, it does set up the story for the up-coming Trilogy in development. That said I hope you enjoy it. This is a JRPG style game, with an emphasis on the storytelling. It features classic side view, turn-based battles with both a Magic and Skill system. Random encounters on the World Map will make you think before setting off on a long journey. While we all enjoy a bit of action, and there is plenty to challenge you, such as an optional boss that will require time and effort, I think nothing grips you better than a good story. And that is what the American Isekai Series will be about. I want the player to feel like they are playing through an Anime, though this game will not feature such elements. Animation is very expensive, and I am saving for the release of the first Game in the Trilogy. While an in-depth story has already been written, I am very interested in the feedback from the STEAM community about the groundwork that has been laid here. I am aware that as it stands this is a cookie cutter RPG, but bear with me as I  wanted feedback while I work on the first game in the trilogy, American Isekai: Season One.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1594746295","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350630/page.bg.jpg?t=1594746295","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350630/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1594746295","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1350630/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1594746295","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Thanks for stopping by, This game is a short introductory into the American Isekai world that I've created.
