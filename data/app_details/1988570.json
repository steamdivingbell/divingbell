{"about_the_game":"In the future, humanities greed and lust have given way to the powers of darkness, and the world is covered in black. Evil has conquered all, and the damned are free to roam the earth. For the few survivors there is little hope. Until, one day, hope arrives in an unexpected form. You play as Beadie, an outcast struggling to find his place in a dying world that is seemingly beyond saving. Unwanted in heaven, unwelcome in hell, it is up to you to guide Beadie on his road to redemption as he traverses countless deadly traps and obstacles searching for a way he can undo the wrongs of his father and atone for the sins of his past.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1988570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1713181579","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1988570/page.bg.jpg?t=1713181579","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1988570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1713181579","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1988570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1713181579","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game includes mild violence associated with character dying."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In the future, humanities greed and lust have given way to the powers of darkness, and the world is covered in black.
