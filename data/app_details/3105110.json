{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">  </h2> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Legendary Warpriests</h2>  <br>  <br>   Sound the Call to War! <br>   <br>  Legendary Warpriests is the latest volume in our new series of class-focused player supplements, this time focused on the sword arm of the faith. This avatar of holy war uses their martial skill and divine power to defend the faithful and crush their enemies. Legendary Warpriests redesigns and enhances the warpriest class granting it more unique, diverse and iconic class abilities that are more reliant upon their deity or faith. No longer will the warpriest be a simple battle-medic given a differentiation from clerics by being able to swift-action cast on themself, instead each warpriest will have a unique set of skill determined by the domains provided by their deity or faith. Along with the redesigned base class are 35 domains to tailor your warpriest to their faith, six new archetypes like the Arsenal Chaplain with their enhanced focus on martial prowess over divine spells or the Forgepriest with focus on artifice and creating tools for the faithful, and 3 archetypes compatible with Spheres. In addition to the class options, there are feats that can enhance the legendary warpriest or other divine-focused classes.
