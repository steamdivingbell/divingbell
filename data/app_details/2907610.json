{"about_the_game":"The wounds of the Sol War are still fresh, the scars etched deep into the collective memory of a broken Federation. An uneasy peace lingers, a fragile truce between shattered planets and the remnants of once-mighty empires. Captain Zara Kincaid is a symbol caught in this crossfire \u2013 a defiant beacon of hope for those clinging to shattered ideals, a broken tool for those who see only ambition and opportunity in the ruins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut when a cosmic pulse ripples through the stars, a chilling whisper amidst the silence, it shatters the illusion of peace. This is not the echo of old wars, but the herald of something far more vast\u2026 and potentially far more destructive. The alien signal pulses with unimaginable power, a promise that might offer salvation\u2026 or accelerate humanity's extinction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan Zara break free from the gilded cage that confines her, expose the ambitions of those who would twist this force to their own ends, and uncover the true nature of this cosmic enigma? The fate of countless worlds hangs in the balance, dangling by the thread of her choices. For in a galaxy already ravaged by war, this newfound power could tip the scales towards a new age of wonder\u2026 or become a requiem for the stars themselves.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712908555","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907610/page.bg.jpg?t=1712908555","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712908555","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2907610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712908555","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The wounds of the Sol War are still fresh, the scars etched deep into the collective memory of a broken Federation.
