A frontal assault is simply too reckless. Lita takes advatage of her Wind Cloak while Endo posesses the ability to turn into fog, allowing both to evade the perils of their adventure.

The only way to step foot into the all-too-risky dungeons is to do so with intoxicated abandon! To top things off, the drunker you become, the less you can tell what's real and what's not, and you may even hallucinate. Your pet dog Odysseus that appears before you may very well be a fiendish demon.
