{"about_the_game":"<strong>1 &amp; 2. Hadley's Run</strong><br><br>Theme song<br><br>I decided to use a lot of D&amp;B in the game. I love the drive and playfulness of the genre, and I think there's a huge gap for it in fast-paced gaming. Millennial me remembers the days in Uni when we would hit up underground D&amp;B parties at Purple Turtle in Cape Town and Mystic Boer in Stellenbosch. There\u2019s something magical about losing your kak (shit) on the dancefloor to those chaotic, fast-paced beats\u2026 you don\u2019t have to think about the moves\u2014you just lose it!<br><br>It\u2019s definitely a genre that needs a resurgence. This was the first real D&amp;B track I ever composed and produced, and it gave me the oomph to keep developing my skills and sticking with it.<br><br><strong>3. Mandela's Meteor Mantra</strong><br><br>Galaxy: New Jozi<br><br>This beat is inspired by Kwaito music, a genre that originated in the townships of South Africa. Any South African can tell you it's the most common beat you'll hear pumping from a minibus taxi or a tuck shop in Cape Town or Johannesburg.<br><br>The name comes from the Cape Afrikaans slang word &quot;kwaai,&quot; which directly translates to &quot;angry,&quot; but in slang, it means something is cool. If you didn't guess it already, the audio sample that's chopped up in this track is none other than Mr. Mandela himself.<br><br><strong>4. 888</strong><br><br>Galaxy: Ezstia<br>Feat. Juan Otto &amp; Roman Gombraikh<br>    <br>This track features a deep dive video (see above)<br><br>This is by far my favourite combat track. I like dark things, I like ancient things... and I love the sound of the Russian language! I would say it's a combination of techno, tribal, trance, and EDM. The track has many different interesting elements, such as counting in Old Sumerian, a Russian speech, some throat singing, and even a Shiva mantra.<br><br><strong>5. A Starship Saga</strong><br><br>Galaxy: Nexus Xyro<br><br>A lazy track. <br><br>A kind of Cinematic &quot;Neo-Western&quot; or &quot;Spiritual Western Trap&quot;.<br>Played a bit between darkness and light. I wanted the kind of \u201cstick em up\u201d shooter feel to the music. A whistle and a hum, some church organ for dramatic effect, a \u201clekker\u201d laid back beat. <br><br><strong>6. Opskop</strong><br><br>Intense, hardcore, old-school D&amp;B. This track probably has the most \u201cchopped up\u201d audio samples out of the entire soundtrack.
