The art style will give you that sentimental feel of the first Laura Bow Mystery, The Colonel\u2019s Bequest.  If you relish the nostalgia of the \u2018old games\u2019 -- perhaps taking you back to your childhood \u2013 this game will do it for you! It has the requisite feel of an Agatha Christie novel, set in the early 20th century. It even has a parser interface, so that you can question the other characters that you meet, develop your hunches, and write your notes along the way . It\u2019s an observational, detective-type of game, and for those who love mysteries and suspense, you should really give this game a chance.
