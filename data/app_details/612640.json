Dunk Lords is a two-on-two basketball beat 'em up featuring over-the-top special moves, devastating dunks, and game-changing equipment. Choose from 20 of the baddest ballers around, each with unique special attacks and abilities, and do battle on a variety of hazard-filled courts.<br><br>Gain the upper hand as you slam opponents with Slice's powerful digital blast, or trap players in grandma's jam jar as Frank the strawberry. But to keep the beatings going, you'll need to earn more special attacks through high-flying dunks or confidence-smashing rejections. Score from shot pads on the court to rack up additional bonuses such as money, extra points, and more. Mega shot pads even allow players to grow to an enormous size and dunk through the ceiling.<br><br>Still not powerful enough? Players can also purchase equipment that increase their abilities.
