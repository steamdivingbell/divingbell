{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">&quot;Rocket Science&quot; is a declassified Soviet Union space program that aims to conquer Mars and the entire Solar system.

[Approval in progress]</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Organize the building of a new-generation space center on the cosmodrome site. Restrict the construction of surface buildings so as to ensure the facility's security and secrecy. Give the go-ahead for the construction and commissioning of underground facilities. Transfer the facility from state financing to full self-sufficiency.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Stage 3</strong>.
