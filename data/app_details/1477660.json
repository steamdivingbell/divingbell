Atlantis, a likely mythical island nation mentioned in Plato\u2019s dialogues \u201cTimaeus\u201d and \u201cCritias,\u201d has been an object of fascination among western philosophers and historians for nearly 2,400 years. Plato (c.424\u2013328 B.C.) describes it as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank, in a night and a day, into the ocean around 9,600 B.C. The ancient Greeks were divided as to whether Plato\u2019s story was to be taken as history or mere metaphor. Since the 19th century there has been renewed interest in linking Plato\u2019s Atlantis to historical locations, most commonly the Greek island of Santorini, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption around 1,600 B.C.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the beginning of the game there is a map which you can choose your destinations.
