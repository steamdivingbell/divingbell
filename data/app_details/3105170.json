{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Taldor, The First Empire<br> <br>  <br> Taldor Endures! <br> The first--and at one point, largest--empire in Avistan after devastation of Earthfall, Taldor has stood for millennia, and though its neighboring nations snicker at its lavish parties and out-of-touch nobility, none dare challenge the mother empire's might! With 6 millennia of history spanning the breadth of a continent, Taldor is a land of long-buried secrets and ruins, partnered with modern cutthroat dramas and political action. Secrets and treasure abound across Taldor--many forgotten, but far more deliberately buried. Will you fight to preserve the glorious traditions of the past, or will you pave the way for a reformed Taldor to attain new heights? <br> Taldor is the dynamic setting for the\u00a0<br> War for the Crown Adventure Path , making this comprehensive guide to the nation's geography, politics, and history a perfect resource for that campaign, as well as for many Pathfinder Module adventures!
