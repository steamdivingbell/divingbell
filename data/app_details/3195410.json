{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unleash chaos with 7 new roles in Betrayal Beach - Island's Curse! (Plus 9 new Skins!)</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Note: The lobby host (and only the host) needs this DLC to use the roles!</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Saboteur Roles:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Cannibal</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Cannibal's don't gain any benefit from normal food or healing items. Each day they may use their ability to get a 'Bite' card, which they can play on another player to steal a hunger point from them. Additionally, whenever a player dies, the Cannibal gets a 'flesh' card. This card can be used to restore health and hunger or poison the campfire.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Trapper</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- The Trapper can use their ability to get a 'Trap' card. They can use this card at a forage location to set a bear trap. The next player that forages at that location will get hit by the trap and take one point of damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Omen</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- The Omen gets a 'Ritual Bones' card that they may use at a forage location to perform a ritual. The next day this location will be clouded with volcanic ash and become treacherous. This means the threat level will increase here much faster than normal.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Killer</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Every couple of days the Killer gets a 'Blowgun' card that can be used to instantly kill another player. Doing so will reveal the Killer with red smoke for a few seconds, so be stealthy or prepare to face the consequnces.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Survivor Roles:</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Investigator</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- The Investigator can use their ability to get a 'Hidden Camera' card. They may play this card on another player, then each time that player moves to a new location the Investigator will be notified.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Engineer</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- The Engineer can get a Frequency Blocker which they may play on a totem or saboteur cache. This will prevent the saboteur from using suffering points to activate them. If a totem or cache activation is successfully blocked in this way the Engineer will be notified.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Leader</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- If there is a Leader in the game exile voting will change so that only the Leader player gets to vote. So stay on the Leader's good side if you want to avoid being tossed into the volcano.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u>Cursed</u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- When a Cursed player dies the Saboteur shrine will not reset to the first level like normal. Instead, it will increase to maximum level, meaning the Saboteurs will get a sacrifice the next night. Exiling a Cursed player could be potentially very dangerous for the Survivors, but can you really trust someone who claims to be cursed?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734561737","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195410/page.bg.jpg?t=1734561737","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195410/d222782b5621cd9e5831c7c4eaf13f6174670eb3/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734561737","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195410/d222782b5621cd9e5831c7c4eaf13f6174670eb3/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734561737","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Unleash chaos with 7 new roles in Betrayal Beach - Island's Curse!
