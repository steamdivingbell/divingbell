{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT FOR THAT BALL</h2><br>A minimalistic football fighting 2D platformer with extensive custom maps support. Fast four-player couch coop fun with obstacles, explosions and a bit of fighting!<br><br>It is a football game in its essence, two teams with up to two players per team. During play, the primary objective is to score a point by kicking the ball into the opponent's goal. Actually, from which side does not matter, as long as it passes the two poles. You can fight a bit to gain a time advantage or block attacks and heavy shots on the goal.<br><br>You can draw a map in any paint app that supports PNG files. Put it into the game and have a good old scrap on it. Probably the most exciting feature is the custom maps support with its many additional settings for the maps to give you even more freedom to come up with crazy stuff.<br><br>Fight for that Ball also comes with Steam Remote Play support, a target practice mode to improve your timing and shooting skills, a couple of team statistics and achievements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Background</h2><br>Even if it does not look like much, I started work on that game a while ago. After my friends and I had some fun matches in a similar minigame back then, I thought it would be fun to have it a bit faster and more maps. Here we are six years later, a fast football platformer where you can bring your own drawings to shape the map.  I enjoy the wacky ball physics and strange fights, so I hope that some of you can have the same fun.<br><br>I'm thrilled to see what maps you come up with. So, please share your maps, thoughts or experiences over in the Steam Community section.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create custom maps</h2><br>You can create your own Fight for that Ball custom maps with two steps. The base layer is a PNG file containing the stage colliders. Every part of the image that is not white will be seen as a collider. The background should be white or transparent. The next layer is a JSON file for advanced map options to move and rotate goals, move player or ball spawn points. Custom maps must be stored in &quot;%userprofile%/Appdata/LocalLow/Beardman Studios/fightforthatball/CustomMaps/&quot;. Fight for that Ball comes with a custom map guide. You can find all files in the custom maps directory under CustomMapGuide. Both files must have the same name, E.g. test.png and test.json. The JSON file is not required. The game would load the default positions for goals and spawn points if no JSON file was found.<br><br>Stay safe! &lt;3","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Practice is everything!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/1273e780c0a09564b8e37773e4d240f808fa7ee4.jpg"},{"name":"I have a friend!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"},{"name":"Almost fair!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"},{"name":"Almost a party!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"},{"name":"Just Started!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"},{"name":"Game on!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"},{"name":"100 Matches","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"},{"name":"So much time...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1565870/389841093cdba9844328792e79e882ab582ad5cc.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1621440012","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565870/page.bg.jpg?t=1621440012","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1621440012","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1565870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1621440012","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Players can punch each other to stun them during a match."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FIGHT FOR THAT BALL</h2><br>A minimalistic football fighting 2D platformer with extensive custom maps support.
