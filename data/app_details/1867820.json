{"about_the_game":"In Orbital Mechanics you take the role of a small mining robot, tasked with mining the energy rich power-crystals found on nearby asteroids. However, you are set upon by crystal pirates with their sole goal of stealing the crystals. Use your weapons to combat the pirates! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe left mouse button operates your main weapon. A fast, low-power weapon which can be used to break crystals. The right mouse button utilises the EMP weapon. This is a much stronger, slower weapon which runs on the energy of blue power-crystals. Additionally, it has the ability to weaken the crystal pirates shield. You can also tether yourself to other nearby asteroids by looking at one and holding 'Tab' while floating in space.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1867820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651845160","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1867820/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1651845160","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1867820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651845160","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1867820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651845160","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In Orbital Mechanics you take the role of a small mining robot, tasked with mining the energy rich power-crystals found on nearby asteroids.
