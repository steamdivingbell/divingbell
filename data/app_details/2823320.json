Midnight Racer aims to capture the spirit of old arcade games with a modern twist. You don\u2019t compete with other players in real-time here. The main goal of the game is to put you in a trance-like state, allowing you to kill time and stop thinking about anything, no matter your mood.<br><br>To enhance your gaming experience, the game allows you to turn off the music while keeping the other sounds. This way, you\u2019re encouraged to play your own music in the background. This game is best enjoyed with your favorite songs.<br><br>The game allows you to drive very fast cars, which will require significant skill to stay on track, as well as slower ones designed for a more relaxed experience.<br>To further support your choice of play style, Midnight Racer features a chill mode where there\u2019s no time or score pressure. The tracks in this mode are also much easier.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2823320/extras/gif_1.gif?t=1737388823\" /><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Drift!
