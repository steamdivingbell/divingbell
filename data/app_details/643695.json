{"about_the_game":"Take your simulation to the next level with these gorgeous Low Window Corridor Coaches! Built from 1926 to 1929 under the direction of Southern CME Richard Maunsell, these classical carriages were built to replace much of the wooden bodied pre-grouping stock Southern inherited from its constituents. The new carriages were based upon the former LSWR &quot;Ironclad&quot; carriage designs, and comprised First and Third Class compartments, each of which contained a corridor and doors for each compartment, enabling quick egress on commuter services.<br><br>The Southern usually ran their carriages in defined sets, though many individual carriages were classified as &quot;Loose&quot; and could be added to trains when required, this was the case with many BCK's and TK's. It was common practise to combine sets to make longer trains in busy periods.<br><br>The Maunsell's would be seen over all the Southern network on suitable tracks. On trains to the west of England it was common practice to place a number of BCK's at the end of a consist. These where dropped off at station with branches when the train stopped, and formed the branch trains, sometimes with a TK. Sadly, withdrawals started in 1960 with the last of the stock withdrawn from passenger duties in the mid 60's.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br>The Maunsell 59ft Low Window Corridor Coach Pack Southern Malachite Green for TS Marketplace includes the following coach types:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Brake Composite<br></li><li>Brake Third<br></li><li>Corridor Composite<br></li><li>Corridor First<br></li><li>Open Third<br></li><li>Restaurant First Kitchen (Early)<br></li><li>Restaurant First Kitchen (Late)<br></li><li>Corridor Third<br></li><li>Download size: 94.9 MB</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643695/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728636857","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643695/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728636857","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643695/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728636857","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/643695/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728636857","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Take your simulation to the next level with these gorgeous Low Window Corridor Coaches!
