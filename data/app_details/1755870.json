{"about_the_game":"<strong>ABOUT THIS GAME</strong><br>Monsters roam the streets of the city, including you! Fight off sinister creatures while stopping yourself from turning into one too in this deck building card game. Craft a unique deck each round from Day cards, Night cards, and Monster cards. Do you try to stay above board and beat your opponents through clever investigation and tactics, use the seeder underbelly of the city to your advantage, or embrace your burgeoning evil instincts? Or maybe mix a bit of all three! Pick one of six different classic monsters to play as. Unlock new cards and characters as you play, unlocking more and more playstyles and strategies. Themed after 1950's horror comics, build the story of your battle with the cards you play.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755870/extras/SteamBanner_Discord.png?t=1666493967\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1755870/extras/SteamBanner_text_strategicdeckbuilding.png?t=1666493967\" /><br>In classic deck building fashion, buy cards to use to damage your opponent, protect yourself, or just buy even better cards in the future.
