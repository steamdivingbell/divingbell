{"about_the_game":"In this game, you are not a banana, you are Dave, because you like to eat bananas, so the banana is taken away, the only way to get it is to kill other Dave. When you have the highest kill count, you will will get bananas. The whole game is a multiplayer battle type, you can configure your own gun or knife to fight against others. There are multiple maps in the game, you can get coins by killing enemies to upgrade, you can upgrade the movement speed, The upper limit of blood volume, but if you are accidentally killed, all upgrades will be cleared, which is a bit similar to roguelike, but it is a multiplayer battle type. And the map has a very hot back room recently, and my favorite strange core, which will definitely make your eyes shine.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"BANANA GO  BRRRRRR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/65aee0d92f315e2ade4f39e4718516b4c7eea29b.jpg"},{"name":"FIRST KILL","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/ca3be75c59e1a518e6cb0642235193b451e4478e.jpg"},{"name":"BBQ's Sniper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/5f78cc57250d0d63d0be42cbb02c69cd1debb5c8.jpg"},{"name":"Become Dev","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/2d6b8b2fd9133be2faa1729739396e918100caf4.jpg"},{"name":"I am good at grappling","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/469983c5fe42905487dfd2ca8bda2482b8ed0060.jpg"},{"name":"I love banana","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/33fde170d1597ef07fc5c31cad062251a0289826.jpg"},{"name":"This is a betray","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/165f6422e59e49dacd945448d5b29a2798d363b9.jpg"},{"name":"I am a noob","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/9e4bb1b212633cce4485bf57a30403c14349a65c.jpg"},{"name":"Rifleman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/79e94c632473907f1476de22369f5428d0ee5443.jpg"},{"name":"Thunder King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1949740/f0ba6cc35237c3d71f24aaa6c5b34ee9ea6e7106.jpg"}],"total":35},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1949740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695391307","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1949740/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1695391307","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1949740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695391307","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1949740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695391307","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this game, you are not a banana, you are Dave, because you like to eat bananas, so the banana is taken away, the only way to get it is to kill other Dave.
