{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game attracts players with its simple yet engaging visuals, featuring a lively red ball rolling forward on a bright yellow track. Players use the A and D keys to control the ball's position, skillfully avoiding various geometric obstacles that randomly appear on the track. The longer the ball rolls without hitting any obstacles, the higher the player's score becomes. However, if the ball touches any obstacle, the game ends immediately, and the player must restart the challenge. The background music is cheerful, and the sound effects are well-designed, with a crisp sound indicating each successful dodge, enhancing the game's interactivity and fun. Whether you're looking for a light-hearted entertainment or aiming to achieve a high score, this game offers a satisfying experience for all.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3499050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1739013228","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3499050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1739013228","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3499050/93a40598bd616a5ec6aa6c62bcc484c85a2ff961/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739013228","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3499050/93a40598bd616a5ec6aa6c62bcc484c85a2ff961/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739013228","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game attracts players with its simple yet engaging visuals, featuring a lively red ball rolling forward on a bright yellow track.
