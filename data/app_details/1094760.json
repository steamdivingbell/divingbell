Due to the comic-like and fairytale-like graphic style, there is no everyday reference. This makes it possible for 12- to 15-year-olds to differentiate the game world from reality and to distance themselves from the game. The observer perspective also creates a distinction between the players and reality.\r\nMilitary and fighting game scenarios are graphically depicted in such a way that they are clearly fictitious for this age group. The depiction of violence in combat scenarios is also perceived as unrealistic, since the adversaries are fantastic creatures and they are represented in a comic-like manner. Thus, there is no reference to everyday life and the behavior shown is not used to resolve conflicts. Threats and conflicts that arise do not span the entire game.\r\nThe audiovisual means only serve to create the atmosphere. The game also contains fighting sounds that only serve to point out what is happening. Combat scenarios should not be visually or auditory disturbing or emotionally damaging.\r\nThe pressure to act that arises in the course of the game and the associated coping with game tasks must be accomplished for 12 to 15 year olds. More complex tasks and problems require the ability to think abstractly and logically, which is also appropriate for this age group."},"demos":[{"appid":1773680,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h1>Short description</h1><p>Stonedeep is an 2.5D underground city builder.
