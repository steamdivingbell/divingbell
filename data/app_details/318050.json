{"about_the_game":"<strong>CONTAINER PRODUCTS \u2013 20/40FT DRY VAN CONTAINERS</strong><br><br>Some months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers. From that time, I planned to make and place these cool iron boxes into my favorite simulator, making our experiences more awesome and more realistic. <br><br>Now, you will get a total of 10 styles of 20ft and 40ft dry van containers in your railroad world. You are able to carry them by X2K double-stack container well wagons.<br><br>Features Include: <br>- 10 styles.<br>- Normal Maps.<br>- Weathered. <br><br><strong>X2K DOUBLE-STACK CONTAINER WELL WAGONS</strong><br>If you intend to travel between Shanghai and Beijing by train, maybe you'll pass a train with double-stacked containers - chances are it will be these, as the X2 series well wagons are the only double-stack container wagons in China. <br><br>The X2 series double-stack container well wagon is specially designed to carry container traffic. Once a X2 wagon equips ZK6 bogies, it\u2019s called \u201cX2K\u201d, and its max speed is up to 120 km/h. <br><br>Three colors of X2K wagons are included, which should be mixed in a long train for a more realistic effect!<br><br>Features Include:<br>- Normal Maps.<br>- Weathered.<br>- Rear Sign Light.<br>- Load Product.<br>- LOD System.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/318050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447363116","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/318050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447363116","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/318050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447363116","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/318050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447363116","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>CONTAINER PRODUCTS \u2013 20/40FT DRY VAN CONTAINERS</strong><br><br>Some months ago, when I was walking around a large shipping terminal in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, I saw many colourful containers stacked together - which came from all over the world - looking like towering blocks of beautiful skyscrapers.
