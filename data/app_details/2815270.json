Then, set up a date with the new date-planning system. You\u2019ll choose where to go and what to do, crafting romantic rendezvous that\u2019ll leave Sims swooning. Sims can connect by playing games, cuddling in bed, or taking the Romantic Blanket to a beautiful spot for a special moment.<br><br></li><li><strong>All About Attraction</strong> \u2014 What works for your Sim? Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs will determine how attracted Sims are to each other. They can include interests, interactions, and more! Discover these as your Sims get to know their partners, build relationships, and maintain Romantic Satisfaction. Since Sims will like and dislike different interactions, partners might have different satisfaction levels.
