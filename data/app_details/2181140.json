{"about_the_game":"Arcades as they once existed are all but dead. Personally, we thought that sucked. The Hope's End Arcade is our attempt to revive the feel and spirit classic arcade games for the modern era. We want to deliver fast, chaotic experiences that don't require committing to investing an hour or longer to play a single session of a game. We want to provide games that deliver the arcade experience you remember (but with the benefit of more modern game design mechanics and concepts).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we invite take a walk with us into our (virtual) arcade. See if there's a game (or several) that strike your fancy. You can purchase each game individually as DLC for Hope's End, like adding a new arcade cabinet to your collection. We're not out to charge you quarter by quarter like the arcades of old, once the game's yours, it's yours for good. You can play two of the ability sets in our first game, The Psions, for free to take the concept for a spin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why not take a break and enjoy a game or two? Soak in the atmosphere of a bygone era. Enjoy the havoc and the freedom that a bit of classic arcade chaos can bring, unconstrained by levels, progression, daily missions, or other nonsense that just distracts from the pure fun where it's just you and the game.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1689474183","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181140/page.bg.jpg?t=1689474183","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689474183","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689474183","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Arcades as they once existed are all but dead.
