{"about_the_game":"If you are tired of the normal everyday adult games with virtually the same stories and cliches- then I invite you to try something fresh, unique, and darker.  Like all Anaxverse games, this one revolves around corruption and transformation fetishes! Desideratum: Blood Bonds is essentially an adults-only sexual Visual Novel and Video Game.  Switching perspectives between the Nosferatu, Brone Lorcan, and the monster hunter, Absinthe Van Gothen, a rich story unfolds before you.  It allows a choice between a Story Mode (avoiding all turn-based combat and resource management) for casual play, or a Game Mode for those that want to play the Monster Hunts as Absinthe and collect items, artifacts, and defeat creatures from mythology, folklore, and legend.  D:BB is canonical and chronologically 5th in the Anaxverse series.  However, it is completely stand alone as well, and can be enjoyed just as much even without previous other tales.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3203310/extras/AboutThisGameDBB.png?t=1738299653\" /><br><br>You have a choice, like in all Anaxverse games.

You can buy weapons and potions from him.  By utilizing different weapons and attacks you will be able to defeat the myriads of monsters.
