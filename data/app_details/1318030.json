{"about_the_game":"Fractal Alchemist is a tool for creating and exploring 3D Fractal worlds. You can create your own mathematical Universe and travel around it. You don't need any knowledge of mathematics to work with the Alchemist - the Alchemist allows you to create formulas for complex fractals by simply stacking cubes. In this sense, Fractal Alchemist is a visual programming tool that does not require you to learn programming languages and mathematics, but nevertheless allows you to create programs, edit them and instantly see the result of your work. Three-dimensional fractals is a little-studied area of mathematics and you can participate in the research of this phenomenon while playing around and exploring your own creations.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1318030/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1600736756","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1318030/page.bg.jpg?t=1600736756","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1318030/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1600736756","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1318030/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1600736756","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Fractal Alchemist is a tool for creating and exploring 3D Fractal worlds.
