{"about_the_game":"T.I.M.E is a First-Person, Arena, Boomer Shooter that pits players against each other in a one-on-one contest.

We are proud of the experience created, and as is the nature of game development, we wish some things could be done differently, but that is life.<br>You <strong>may</strong> find minor bugs, issues, complaints and wish some things were done differently. But we respectfully ask you to try enjoy the unique experience crafted and take it for what it is. Thank you taking the time (<i>heh heh heh</i>) to play our game and even read this.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>The gameplay consists of Online/Networked 1v1 lobbies. In a best-of-five format with one life per round, eliminate your opponent 3 times, you win! <br>However, once an opponent is beaten and the round ends, the loser gets to rewind to any point in time that has previously occurred, this is where the next round will start.<br><br>Enemy flanked you last round? Rewind so it doesn't happen next time.<br>Enemy picked up the weapon you were after? Rewind and set a trap for them.<br><br>Not everything is sided for the losing player though, if you win a round, you're one step closer to victory and you also get to choose what Power Weapon is in play.<br><br>The ultimate way to test pure skill, the removal of &quot;I would have&quot; or &quot;I should have&quot;.

With no way back on track to their Utopian plan and infighting set in, the top brass have decided to buy themselves some time to make amends. Their solution clouded by idealism, smog, and desperation is to rewind time to a point where they can find out where it all went wrong.

This results in conflict among factions of the regime, causing deeper paradoxes, alternate timelines, and crippling confusion.<br><br>Thrust into the shoes of the upper echelons of the military superpower in their final days the player must deal with their opposition &amp; their time loop.
