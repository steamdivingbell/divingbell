{"about_the_game":"<strong>Little Hats</strong> is an open-world survival game mixed with RPG elements, in which you play as a Gnome! Set in a handcrafted fairy tale world inspired by Dutch culture and folklore. You will have to survive, craft, build, and explore, to discover why the gods sent you down to the world. To do this you will first have to find a way to the lowlands while avoiding all kinds of danger along the way. Or enable <strong>Cozy Mode!</strong>, which will disable all monsters and scary creatures, making for a relaxing experience where you can focus solely on exploring and building.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487800/extras/ezgif.com-resize__2_.gif?t=1729511409\" /><br><br><strong>Explore a Fairy Tale World</strong><br>Visit the gnome cities to buy or trade items and objects with your fellow gnomes. Explore a diverse forest with many different types of terrain, and many animals. Become enchanted by the beautiful fairies, and sneak your way through big human towns and villages. Talk to the humans, gnomes, and other creatures to find out the secrets and history of Steynwoud. But most importantly, stay clear of any and all trolls! <br><br><strong>Gathering, Crafting, Building</strong><br>Live fully off the land by gathering resources and crafting everything yourself, or make some coins and buy a workbench in one of the gnome shops, the choice is yours! Build your house brick by brick, or plank by plank, for maximum originality! Or build your house faster and more traditionally by placing an entire wall at once, or do both, it's all up to you! <br><br><strong>Inspiration for Little Hats</strong><br>The game is primarily inspired by Dutch artist Anton Pieck, and his drawings which often depicted old nostalgic scenes from the Netherlands, and also scenes from fairy tales/folklore. On top of that, I have drawn inspiration from various other artists such as Rien Poortvliet, Arthur Rackham, and many other (mainly) Dutch artists and pieces of folklore.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Fox Rider","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/75900d49e87c9c52fbc70962d77f2fdad32b512c.jpg"},{"name":"Deer Rider","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/83937a8573ae469e486b7d7a687006d4a36ca077.jpg"},{"name":"You've been gnomed ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/1ba49f636bc8e824f76a48a65f5d9c4f14610a49.jpg"},{"name":"Golden Horn","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/2dff01f65048f91f8ac38cb0cb64433330d86ea6.jpg"},{"name":"Golden Tuning Fork","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/2744db9f2126b0e8a51b1f783d3c2b04e0d24e08.jpg"},{"name":"Brick Mason","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/506042b40eb01d3cba0bc2a639a07d40b69600cb.jpg"},{"name":"Gnome Sailor","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/516c7ac2438b8cf89690875798095e37200f9a61.jpg"},{"name":"Ravenwoud Discovered","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/4c30f7ca3bbf4f62ef2664cfb3153142f4b1f0ea.jpg"},{"name":"Lumber-Gnome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/199f71c3ca0b7aec90d8192d35dffdc950021781.jpg"},{"name":"Evil Gnome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1487800/d275e5051fc9142e7db0618494061ce024f3091d.jpg"}],"total":26},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729511409","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487800/page.bg.jpg?t=1729511409","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729511409","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1487800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729511409","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Little Hats</strong> is an open-world survival game mixed with RPG elements, in which you play as a Gnome!
