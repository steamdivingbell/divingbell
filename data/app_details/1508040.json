It is not clear who will be the killer and who will be the victim. Whether you are a killer or a victim, you can always counteract. If you are tired of running away, this game is for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Our first killer in early access is &quot;MORY&quot;</strong></h2><br>Mory is a killer with an unfortunate life story. He is waiting for his victims in these cursed and forgotten lands. He has many different abilities to torture. Tasting them or make others taste them is up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Are you prey or hunter?</strong></h2><br>There are multiple options for the survivors. If you want, you can end all this by hunting the killer, or you can run away.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Annoying people are not allowed!</strong></h2><br>We have no forgiveness for annoying people as in other multiplayer games. Once we complete the system we are working on, you will never meet these people again. GG!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Give us your feedback</strong></h2><br>You can always reach us on our Discord channel. We care about your ideas and consider them. We also have <u>special surprises</u> for our players who support us at the early access stage.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1614178458","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1614178458","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1614178458","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1614178458","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Contains violence"},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508040/extras/Join_DC.png?t=1614178458\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1508040/extras/ass_gif.gif?t=1614178458\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>More than survival games</strong></h2><br>As the Assemble team, we aim to offer you a game that is constantly renewed and provides different experiences. &quot;Assemble&quot; is a survival and action game that supports up to 7 players.
