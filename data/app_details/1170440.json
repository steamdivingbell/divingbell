Play as Arridaios, one of the leading members of the rebellion. People look up to him and hope that their revolt will succeed. But Arridaios is reluctant in helping the people. He wants to live in what little peace he has. Things don't go the way as planned. Arridaios discovers that his friend went missing. And along the way in finding him, he sees something he dreads. Something he never wants to see again.
