{"about_the_game":"From the creators of What Remains of Edith Finch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore a mysterious all-white landscape by splatting paint to reveal the world around you in The Unfinished Swan. As Monroe, a 10-year-old orphan, you'll follow a swan that's stepped out of an unfinished painting and wandered off into a surreal, storybook-inspired kingdom. Each chapter brings surprises, new ways to explore the world, a host of bizarre (and sometimes dangerous) creatures, and encounters with the eccentric king who built this empire.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Painter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/d161a51452dbd9a08e2b6d05b1f86117814d9182.jpg"},{"name":"Climber","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/79b57a73620fcef5c03d02eba6c6b8ed4a0d6393.jpg"},{"name":"Night Owl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/8c5817bfd0400435ab7e20aa6282fb319f8469a3.jpg"},{"name":"Dreamer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/491baf4663e3910f37851dff78af3f6c122aaefc.jpg"},{"name":"Rocketeer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/f0a03390257fbb2f18743bbde39b263a9b515d17.jpg"},{"name":"Spaceman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/ebe20ed01c6e72fb27c4ef2b7ad0a4ec7ba1a991.jpg"},{"name":"Balloonist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/260644e735782869dc9db3f2915c41d25a4b6dfd.jpg"},{"name":"Page Turner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/b491ad0ea4c258a145c0b5d6767c515a3316776a.jpg"},{"name":"Minimalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/141eed54ca2a670f604a9882d5d58704c28a617b.jpg"},{"name":"Telescopic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1206430/340f51be44db58384667ae11c5ace94291cbe86c.jpg"}],"total":10},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1206430/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729099245","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1206430/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729099245","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1206430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729099245","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1206430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729099245","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"From the creators of What Remains of Edith Finch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore a mysterious all-white landscape by splatting paint to reveal the world around you in The Unfinished Swan.
