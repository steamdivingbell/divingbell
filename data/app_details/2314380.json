Blow those mothermonsters up with the only way he knows how - blast off into space on a wild adventure to find himself a shit hot rock 'n' roll band.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRelentlessly fun with a bumping soundtrack to boot, come save the world with Billie and jam along to some hot new rock 'n' roll bangers from Down Under.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContains 6 levels based on classic games from the 80s, 90s and now!<br />\r\n- Collect music gear and blast monsters with a laser gun in a platformer, climb ladders, slide under enemies and explore secret rooms.<br />\r\n- Fly a spaceship through a classical shoot 'em up, blasting enemy ships with your laser guns and avoiding attacks.<br />\r\n- A OG DK style platformer, jump over kegs, shoot those same monsters, climb up ladders and collect gear to steal back your amplifier from Deadbeat Darryl!<br />\r\n- Fly your spaceship through a blackhole, dodging the edges of the tunnel and the mines and enemy ships within.<br />\r\n- Relaxingly float through the center of the blackhole, filled with mines to avoid<br />\r\n- Surf a cosmic wave, avoiding enemies and giant fish, and even go skateboarding for good measure, jumping over and avoiding obstacles<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's a nice, simple game - all you need is four directional keys and a spacebar to go on amazing rock 'n' roll journey into outer space and back. It's groovy and relaxing, if you're into fast-paced action and explosions.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1682555892","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314380/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1682555892","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314380/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1682555892","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2314380/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1682555892","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"\u200bBillie Eternal and the Jetcats in...
