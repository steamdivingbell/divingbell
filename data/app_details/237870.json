{"about_the_game":"In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2><br>Planet Explorers right now only features single player. <br><br>In single player there are 3 distinct selections <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story Mode</strong> \u2013 Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore.
