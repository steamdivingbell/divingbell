When facing a large number of targets, they can automatically allocate targets reasonably to intercept units, so as not to be easily defeated by saturation attacks and avoid wasting ammunition. The targets that can be intercepted include enemy fixed wings, helicopters, drones, rockets, missiles, etc. In the past, almost no RTS games could achieve this function</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Artillery setup and auto relocation: All artillery units need to setup before firing, and after firing, they need to pack up before moving, simulate the workflow of artillery work in reality.
