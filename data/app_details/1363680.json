Collect items to craft weird weapons and useful objects that will help you traverse the world in this unplanned escapade.<br> <br>It was supposed to be a relaxing vacation but ditch the itinerary because you\u2019ll now need to choose your own path. Navigate through procedurally generated levels that offer the perfect balance of risk and reward. Help Giorgio and Felicie overcome their differences and work as a team in single-player or co-op.
