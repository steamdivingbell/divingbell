{"about_the_game":"Step back in time and into the shoes of a time-traveling inventor in Temporian, an exciting turn-based survival game taking inspiration from the hit anime series, Dr. Stone. Stranded in a prehistoric world, you face a series of thrilling challenges on your quest to repair your time machine.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/extras/Speed.gif?t=1720142803\" /><br><br>As the time traveler, you're tasked with creating resources that have yet to exist in this era. Utilize your ingenuity to (re)invent everything from apple pie to electricity, as each step brings you closer to your present-day home.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Over 100 Unique Recipes</h2>Journey through centuries of innovation as you craft over 100 unique items. Every creation aids your quest to return to the present. Proceed with caution though, as careful planning is necessary for your settlement, and mastering new technologies, recipes, and meals will require clever combinations of cards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complex Dilemmas</h2>Expansion of your settlement presents increasingly complex dilemmas. Will you invest in infrastructure, or expend limited resources on better tools and equipment? When settlers fall ill, will you allocate time to heal them, risking other aspects of survival? Choices matter, and like reality, there's rarely a single correct answer.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/extras/Choices.png?t=1720142803\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Endings</h2>Your choices in Temporian ripple through time, drastically impacting the game's outcome. With numerous endings shaped by your actions, your inventions, and your time-altering decisions, reaching the future is one thing - but will it be the future you left behind?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/extras/BadEnding.png?t=1720142803\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">No Combat, Just Strategy</h2>Temporian foregoes combat, focusing instead on experimentation, planning, and consequential decision-making. Play at your own pace and feel no pressure to take unnecessary risks. It's your survival, and your strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer Campaign</h2>Embark on a full multiplayer campaign in Temporian. Opt for cooperation or competition - the choice is yours. Aid your friends by sending tools, food, or resources to survive harsh winters, or use them to offload unwanted waste. Retaining the turn-based nature of Temporian, play with a friend, and see who can return home first, or work together and return at the same time. How you play is completely in your hands.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Farmer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/47fe4bbb932765b26bc0cb9333d0efe1a1b9cce6.jpg"},{"name":"Home Owner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/50727d0f13a81aa83486b0ac366dba8aabf8658b.jpg"},{"name":"Trader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/7b8e81629aba20c0f02b7eb0d76310526bf81f2f.jpg"},{"name":"Advanced Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/6bbf6488486b0f72706f322c245454fa2e4a377f.jpg"},{"name":"Old Age Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/760b2da3de3512a1cc577a0215e37dd55b2b34a5.jpg"},{"name":"Apocalypse Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/643326452961994fdaf167685681549eb1420d87.jpg"},{"name":"Immortal Ruler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/4bda2bd793d640d438c52693baaf73ec25dc9786.jpg"},{"name":"Benevolent Ruler","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/0c0db1c2d4a2bf9f09e305cc58832bc1a0ee9469.jpg"},{"name":"Return Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/b6a1d407546048e2b31fbefd59cfc694b9e093e1.jpg"},{"name":"Send the Traveler home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2229920/2decbd046fb50fe3ddf00743b97dcb14b76284a8.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1720142803","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/page.bg.jpg?t=1720142803","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720142803","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2229920/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720142803","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Step back in time and into the shoes of a time-traveling inventor in Temporian, an exciting turn-based survival game taking inspiration from the hit anime series, Dr. Stone.
