Will you be able to overcome the dungeons of Through with your friends? Or will you get lost along the way?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COOPERATE!</h2>Play with your friends to reach the end of each of the proposed levels. The more players, the more fun and laughter! Remember that friendly fire is a reality.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DISCOVER!</h2>Each level contains different paths and options so you can enjoy them with all the character archetypes available. This allows you and your friends to enjoy different experiences in each level depending on your character choices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BATTLE!</h2>Whether you prefer to fight alongside your friends or against them, it's always relaxing to take a few hits (and enjoy a moment of each impact). You just have to open one of the Arenas or try the Battle mode, similar to Adventure but against your companions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SCORE!</h2>There are shiny little things scattered throughout the levels for you and your buddies to search like good treasure diggers (dwarven folk approves) and get the best score possible. Remember that if you play in battle mode, your score will depend on how well you compete against your teammates!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091660/extras/Through_characters.png?t=1730326058\" /><br>You will embody one of these <strong>adventurers</strong> in your next exploration in Through.

When full, use one of two special abilities for enhanced resistance or damage. Be cautious, your attacks might hit teammates, but we won't stop you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091660/extras/hunter_render.gif?t=1730326058\" /><br>An agile archer keeps a safe distance from enemies, as long as you have arrows. You can retrieve fired arrows or reload at ammo boxes. His keen senses detect nearby traps, allowing you to warn teammates or let chaos reign.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091660/extras/sage_render.gif?t=1730326058\" /><br>Dressed in a grey robe and hat, the sage wields a fire-sparking staff, channeling years of wisdom to cast fireballs.

He can shield himself from damage and kick to push others away.

They won't make it easy for you. You can engage these creatures in combat to defeat them, or try to avoid them, but be careful. They can band together and become a significant threat.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3091660/extras/Enemy_Char.png?t=1730326058\" /><br>In this world, a great danger lurks in the shadows. No one knows where they came from, but one thing is certain: they have been sent to prevent adventurers from succeeding.
