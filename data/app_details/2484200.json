The Museum's main mission is to open a portal to imagination. The Museum offers visitors an opportunity to experience and learn about some of the most important science and science fiction artifacts and achievements. The Museum shows how science fiction continually inspires individuals, influences cultures, and impacts societies. Also serving as an educational catalyst to expand interest in the science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) areas to engage and entertain. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Museum of Science Fiction believes that science fiction is rich with ideas that can serve as a springboard for curiosity and seeks to make a measurable positive impact on STEAM-related educational activities. Based on the belief that science fiction holds educational value for all ages, the Museum's VR galleries are designed to educate and spark interest in STEAM through science fiction. The VR Museum will eventually include  a major entrance hall, seven themed galleries, and outside spaces. The seven galleries include: Creators, Time Travel, Lifeforms, Computers and Robots, Vehicles, Technology, and Other Worlds. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEducational Focus<br />\r\nThe VR Museum of Science Fiction is designed to mix science educational content within an engaging and immersive virtual reality science fiction environment. The primary goal for the VR Museum is to provide a rapid point of departure from museums-as-usual and give visitors new ways to interact with science, technology, engineering, art, and math educational content that provides enhanced learning and entertainment experiences. The VR Museum will simultaneously entertain and educate \u2013 presenting visitors with easier ways to understand more challenging scientific concepts like quantum computing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nClass trips from anywhere in the world will enjoy the VR Museum\u2019s amazing educational science content from NASA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab - and even a tour inside of a quantum computer.
