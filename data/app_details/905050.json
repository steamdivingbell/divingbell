In the first days of the operation, positions of 320 ID and 298 ID were smashed and both divisions began retreating in disorder to the west. 298 ID could not be saved and it vanished almost in full under attacks of the Red Army units. Not wishing to lose the second, 320 ID, the German command developed a plan for its rescue: units of the 2nd MIR LSAH will reach the Andreevka area, between Zmiev and Balakleya. 320 ID will also arrive there.
