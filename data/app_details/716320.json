parts of the level where the world literally turns 90 degrees letting the player discover a new area to explore and travel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe levels of the game are not easy to overcome since almost everyone is made up of different traps and enemies, it is for this reason that the game is designed to be overcome using two characters<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWira, the strongest warrior, endowed with a weapon (Iron Hammer), will be in charge of overcoming areas that are populated by enemies, however this character has a limited speed which makes him vulnerable to traps.<br />\r\n<br
