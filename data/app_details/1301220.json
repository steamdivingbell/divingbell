I don\u2019t say this often, but, this game is absolutely perfect from start to finish, and I highly recommend playing it when you have the chance. Get caught up in Angela and Devere\u2019s story, and uncover a little bit of magic.\u201d<br>Blerdy Otome<br><br>\u201cThere are so many things about \u201cDear Devere\u201d I want to praise, which makes it hard for me to start this article. Do I start with applauding the strong worldbuilding and dialogue writing skills of Jasmine Osler? Or should I rather point out the congenial voice acting for the two lead characters, realized by Chintarmanya Vivian as Angela Bard and Mike Young as Mr. Devere? Perhaps I could pass one or two compliments to Paul Robins, the creator of the beautiful soundtrack? Or wait, maybe I could begin by swooning over the well-crafted illustrations for each envelope, that either act as visual, synoptic symbols for the actual scene or as mystical foreshadowings for upcoming events? I am unsure.\u201d<br>Game Curator<br><br>\u201cThis game was so enjoyable and unique. The writing is done really well, and you WILL feel attached to Angela and Devere. Their romance is adorable, and the letter correspondence really fleshed out their characters in ways that I\u2019m not sure showing actual sprites would have done.\u201d<br>Joker VN Reviews<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_05e3c28ec3fdc3566b00a493c66f62dcf529ee91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1723659364","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_05e3c28ec3fdc3566b00a493c66f62dcf529ee91.600x338.jpg?t=1723659364"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_905368d9cca6d6ed64e498935887679739b0ea32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1723659364","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_905368d9cca6d6ed64e498935887679739b0ea32.600x338.jpg?t=1723659364"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_4e5984652f5157798c624e999a6ba581e0759946.1920x1080.jpg?t=1723659364","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_4e5984652f5157798c624e999a6ba581e0759946.600x338.jpg?t=1723659364"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_7ff10341de69d517e739beaec2e6551b833454d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1723659364","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_7ff10341de69d517e739beaec2e6551b833454d5.600x338.jpg?t=1723659364"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_66b5dd0d0a7c55afbc0d0097d16a1a7cae31ba13.1920x1080.jpg?t=1723659364","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301220/ss_66b5dd0d0a7c55afbc0d0097d16a1a7cae31ba13.600x338.jpg?t=1723659364"}],"short_description":"A romance/mystery visual novel set in 1930s Scotland, told through a letter correspondence.","steam_appid":1301220,"support_info":{"email":"","url":"https://katy133.weebly.com/about--contact.html"},"supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong>, Simplified Chinese<br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","type":"game","website":null}
