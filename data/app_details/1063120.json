{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Damaged In Transit</strong></h2>Split your attention in <strong>Damaged In Transit</strong>!<br><br>This mind-bending action-puzzler will leave you cross-eyed! Juggle your two drones and help them deliver their precious cargo. Spikes, pitfalls, flamethrowers and enemy robots will threaten your shipment as you trek across 125 levels of desert oases, coal mines, ports, oil rigs, and the <i>core of the Earth!!!</i> Deftly pilot your drones around the map and use the items you find to open pathways and get those packages delivered safely!<br><br>Embrace the miracle of automated delivery!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Action &amp; Puzzle - Split Your Mind!</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063120/extras/puzzle.gif?t=1585534686\" /><br>The challenge of Damaged in Transit -- and it\u2019s hard -- comes from the need to direct your two self-driving drones across different areas on the map. You'll need to simultaneously manage them both and direct them to where they have to be. Make sure that sending one drone here won\u2019t send the other into danger somewhere else. This becomes increasingly difficult, especially with the combination of obstacles and puzzle elements. You\u2019ll run into spikes that toggle with every input, arrows that flip at the push of a button, gates toggled by lighting beacons, and even evil, flamethrower-wielding robots. It sure starts to feel like you\u2019re juggling knives instead of drones.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Co-op - Great For a Date</strong></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1063120/extras/coop.gif?t=1585534686\" /><br>Damaged In Transit is also great with a partner. But remember, nobody controls the drones themselves, so in co-op mode you\u2019ll split your controls instead -- you\u2019ll need to be on your toes, planning, communicating, and relying on each other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single Player - Juggle both drones by yourself.<br></li><li>Local Co-Op - Juggle both drones with a friend!
