Plan routes around existing structures, relying on tunnels and bridges as necessary, plotting paths from where people are coming to wherever it is they need to go. Establish rules for intersections, determining not just the phases of individual traffic lights (if any are present in the first place), but also designating lanes for specific purposes as you see fit and introducing limitations as needed. Establish rights of way, create pedestrian islands and medians, and even place street lamps, railings, noise-cancelling barriers, and additional decorative elements to bring your spaces to life.

Plot out your roads to maintain a consistent flow of traffic, prevent gridlock, and ensure average speeds are kept above a certain minimum, all while maintaining a reasonable budget. As the challenges go on, you'll take on the difficulties presented by additional vehicle types as they share the road with each other and pedestrians, introducing the need for more and more complex solutions to meet the demands of commuters.
