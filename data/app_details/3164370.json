While he may have appeared to be a good king, many who worked directly under him knew the truth: that he sought greater power than that allowed for him by the crown.

Many chose to follow him out of fear; after all, they could not be killed if they were useful to him.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">     One member of his court stood out, however, and it was not because of his ridiculous choice of clothes or his love of pranks. His name was Ozymandias, and he was the court jester. He was perhaps the king's most trusted court official, and the king would show his love for Ozymandias every day with the finest gifts, foods, and plenty of leniency when his pranks went too far. Ozymandias, however, did not find the same fondness with the king. Ozymandias was a practicing wizard, always searching for all the magic he could possibly learn, and he hoped that one day, he would be able to use his magic to help others, starting with the overthrowing of the king. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">     One day, the king discovered a way to live forever with more power than anyone could possibly imagine. The first step was to become a lich. The king entrusted Ozymandias to gather the supplies and help him obtain his goal. Ozymandias did so more than willingly, and prepared for the ritual.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">     When everything was set, he turned to Ozymandias and thanked him for his help.
