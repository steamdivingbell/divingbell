{"about_the_game":"The tension is thick. Your pursuers have caused you a lot of damage and if they find you now, they'll take everything you've worked for. You'll need to get one of the airplanes working to leave the island, but right now your priority is to find some food or you'll be too depleted to defend yourself.  From your vantage point in a second floor window, you spot a deer cautiously emerging from a grove of trees near the bottom of a wooded hill. Deer can be hunted for food, so you raise your weapon and put your crosshairs over the animal's heart. You are about to pull the trigger when you see the deer start, then run off. You pan your scope to the side and see that the deer was startled by the group of heavily armed players that are now approaching your position.
