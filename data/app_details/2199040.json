My aim for this year is to carry over my Ph.D. research about procedurally generated terrains into my game.

You start with machines of 1906, can you get to the very top and ride on modern machinery?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199040/extras/EN-03.png?t=1727903042\" /><br>Controls are simplified enough to still give you the passion from riding but not too complex to take you hours to learn. It mainly focuses on giving players the best enjoyment from racing fights possible. The core of the game are short dynamic races with a high density of action. The feeling from the ride is very reminiscent of older games, do not expect a hardcore simulator. On the other hand, it's not a mario kart racing game - there are physics and you need to keep that in mind.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199040/extras/EN-04.png?t=1727903042\" /><br>- 100 historic vehicles from 7 nations<br>- 40 real and custom tracks<br>- 1000+ of various vehicle setups<br>- 100+ vehicle patterns<br>- 10 different biomes<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2199040/extras/EN-05.png?t=1727903042\" /><br>You can customize your vehicle and rider as much as you want using a simple yet rich customization system.
