{"about_the_game":"VirtualXT is a core emulator that runs on modern hardware and operating systems. It is designed to be simple and lightweight yet still capable enough to run a large library of old application and games. The default setup emulates a CPU running at 4.77 Mhz just like the original. This is quite a slow system and the original one only operates in real-mode. This means that no protected-mode or 32 bit applications will run. (Most software from the 90's requires a later CPU.)","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2388330?t=1709830351","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388330/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1709830351","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388330/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709830351","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2388330/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709830351","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play on Phone","id":41},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"VirtualXT is a core emulator that runs on modern hardware and operating systems.
