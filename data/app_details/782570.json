{"about_the_game":"Endless Road: Reborn is a roguelike card game published by Sula Box Games where players must use a variety of equipment and skills to defeat vile creatures lurking along a treacherous, endless road. Players will also be faced with choices along the way, testing their decision-making abilities and survival skills. Fear not, for there are several playable characters for you to journey with, each with unique talents and fighting styles. A crazy combination of strategy, unpredictability, and adventure awaits!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782570/extras/\u52a8\u753b.gif?t=1722567220\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782570/extras/\u52a8\u753b2.gif?t=1722567220\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782570/extras/\u52a8\u753b3.gif?t=1722567220\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Eight playable characters, each with different active skills!<br></li><li>Choose from dozens of equipment, jewelry, and gemstones to improve your cards and stats.<br></li><li>Randomly-generated levels.<br></li><li>Heaps of game events and unlockables.<br></li><li>Immersive graphics and music complement a twisted storyline.</li></ul><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782570/extras/Exploring.gif?t=1722567220\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One step at a time.</h2>You can only see what lies just in front of you. Will you be able to see it through to the end?<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1. Eight Classes</h2></strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/782570/extras/heroes.gif?t=1722567220\" /><br>Choose one of eight character classes, each with their own fighting characteristics. <br>Try out their unique talents and find special equipment that is tailored to each class. Some card skills that seem kinda useless on one character may actually be really cool and powerful on another!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2.

Each time you enter a new map, the content, events, and combat objects are randomly generated.<br>Fighting battles and even some random events will drain your health. Don\u2019t let it drop to zero, or else your journey will come to an end. Always remember to eat and tend to your wounds.<br>Restore your lost memory and let the sophisticated and twisted plot unfold by collecting letters that have been left behind.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">3.

There\u2019s some super-rare powerful legendary equipment, spells that restore your health, food, traps, camouflaging fragrances, hard cash, and so on.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4.

However, sometimes it\u2019s wise to defend rather than attack, or set traps and develop a long-term strategy to out-smart the enemy. Your foes may have the power, but you have the brains!<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">5.
