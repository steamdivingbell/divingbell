{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Atompunks 1969</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Atomopia was one of the largest cities. In 1969, its population was large. Its skyline is more impressive than that of other large cities; its metropolis was spread over such vast plains that the buildings could be seen for miles. It was a city full of atomic powered cars, fog, and stubborn atompunks. Its people are such a vivid mixture of races, languages, and colors that they seemed to shine in the lights of the city. The streets were teeming with people on their way to work. As clusters of people walked by, their pace would slow, their stride would lengthen and their eyes would widen, following the shadows cast by the atombots.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Life outside the walls of atomopia was much more brutal, as many struggled to survive. The people of the Wastelands were desperate for access to the advanced sparks, but the pieces of equipment could only be obtained by the wealthiest of the population. The city members attempted to reign in their rebellious nature and ease their pain by constructing a plan. This was geared towards controlling those who resisted their power and the starship factory. An essential part of this plan was they supplied basic foodstuffs to the people. The atombots kept a close eye on these people. Some did not have the strength to fight against them, but they still had courage. The starship factory was not interested in the issue of the safety of the streets, which are the living space of the public.
