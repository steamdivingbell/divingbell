{"about_the_game":"You are the AI in charge of Earth's final interstellar spaceship, tasked with delivering your human crew to a suitable new home among the stars.

With over 30 planets and stations to visit, over 700 choices to make, and near-infinite randomized sector maps to visit, there are countless paths to take across the galaxy.<br><br><strong>A novel's worth of adventure!</strong><br>Over 120,000 words of text across multiple playthroughs provide a rich storyline full of action, suspense, drama and horror.
