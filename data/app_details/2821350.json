He sometimes even dream of unifiying once again with the rest of the country to make it as great as it once was. But then he suddenly met a mysterious girl which is hunted by the ruthless government. The same people who has ruined so many lifes in his own district. Many have been killed. Some have been kidnapped. He has lost count how many exactly by now.<br><br>So he decides to convince his very best friend Tommy to join him on a dangerous journey that will be unlike anything they have ever done before in order to uncover more about the big city of Valborg and rescue the girl from what the govenment has planned to do with her. <br><br><i>What is it that is so important to hide? What has been planned for such a long time in the dark shadows? <br>Battle, and explore your way through this mysterious world with many secrets!</i><br><br><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>Play with strategy and choices with a classic turnbased combat system! Combat and animation's are created to allow for a fast paced gameplay to keep the excitement going while still hooking you onto the visuals! Items can also play a major role during combats. For example you can upgrade your weapon and armory to gain better attack and defense, making it a more creative and varied style of  playing! <br><br>The Maps are inspired by a variety of themes including some dystopian but also technologically advanced and futuristic ones. While other's even offer a more utopian look with old architecture much in contrast to the slums of Alvin's home area!

Gameplay may look different during release.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821350/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735931185","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821350/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735931185","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821350/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735931185","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821350/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735931185","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3352200,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Alvin has long been trying to ignore the brutality arround him everyday in his segregated home district.
