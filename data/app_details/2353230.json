{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Gatewalkers AP 2: They Watched the Stars<br> <br> After learning the truth behind the alien being responsible for their missing memories, the characters join forces with Sakuachi, a young oracle whose destiny is inextricably bound to theirs. To help Sakuachi fulfill her quest to find a living god and seal away an ancient evil, the party travels across frigid northlands toward the demon-ravaged wastes of Sarkoris. As they voyage across the harrowing waters of the Lake of Mists and Veils and push through monster-filled ruins, the party must rely on their own wits, their new friends, and the stars above to guide them to safety. <br> <br> They Watched the Stars is a Pathfinder adventure for four 4th-level characters.
