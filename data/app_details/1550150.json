this game, but with a new style, which is never that half realistic from the video, but a more stylized style.<br>I have decided to do this because it needed a lot of time to create textures for the creatures and everything else, first you need a high-poly model to create normal maps, then a low-poly-model for the game and high quality textures (2k+), otherwise it would look everything blurry...<br>The new style makes it a lot easier, I have directly the game-model and a simple texture (256+) and everything else happens in engine, which decreases the time needed, from 9-12 hours to 1-2 hours.<br>Animations will be shared, all similar creatures have the same animations, nothing special anymore, combined with the new look, it\u00b4s a huge time improvement.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1550150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729745118","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1550150/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729745118","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1550150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729745118","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1550150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729745118","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam
