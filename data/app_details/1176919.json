The United States, fearing the Japanese would use this strategic location as a base to control the northern Pacific Ocean\u2019s sea lanes, launched an assault in May of 1943. The 2,500 Japanese soldiers, mostly of the 301st Independent Infantry Battalion, were dug into the high mountains to defend against the Americans of the 7th and 32nd Infantry Regiments of the 7th Division.

Play ten scenarios on a unique 22\u201dx34\u201d Map that accurately depicts Attu\u2019s harsh terrain. The terrain varies over eight levels in height and features boot-sticking Muskeg, rock-strewn Rough, precipitous Cliffs, and jagged Razorbacks crossing the high peaks of the unforgiving, mountainous landscape. Through the fog and unexpected high winds, known to the Aleuts as \u201cWilliwaws,\u201d both sides struggle to hold and take ground. Clevesy Pass, Cold Mountain, Point Able, Engineer Hill, the Sarana Valley, and Prendergast Ridge are all fought over. The fighting is hex by hex, yard by yard, bullet by bullet, hand to hand, and it won\u2019t end until the last Japanese soldier is vanquished.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176919/extras/Hell_Frozen_Over_Break3.jpg?t=1678239272\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1176919?t=1678239272","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176919/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1678239272","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176919/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678239272","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176919/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678239272","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>The Frozen Hell Called Attu</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176919/extras/Hell_Frozen_Over_Break.jpg?t=1678239272\" /><br>In June of 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army seized the island of Attu in the Aleutian Islands of the United States Alaskan Territory.
