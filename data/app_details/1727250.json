Recently, it had escalated to the point of no return. Meanwhile, the Weins kidnapped the Princess of Bangaona kingdom while she was in the disputed region, the famous Boto Island, claimed by both of the kingdoms. This particular incident added fuel to the fire further worsening the relationship between the kingdoms. The Princess was the most important member of the Bangaona kingdom because she was the one looking after the military technology. Thanks to her leadership, Bangaona got a few modernized weapons and turrets. <br><br>Weins kingdom had already built the towers and the various types of buildings where various modernized turrets were manufactured.

Despite the economic and the military disparity between the two kingdoms, Bangaona had its advantage over the Weins in terms of having some powerful super soldiers with supernatural abilities, and at the same time, having a good strategic location. <br><br>The King of Bangaona requested the Hero, one of the strongest warriors of the kingdom, to rescue the princess at any cost. Having a special supernatural ability to convert the Enemy buildings, the Hero is strong and capable of eliminating tens and hundreds of soldiers on his own.
