It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>In a savage land where the gods manipulate mortals like pawns on a chess board, Wolf's divine power controlled you and protected you. But since Wolf's death, the eyes of Hawk, Spider, Bear, Gazelle, and Eel are upon you. The embers of Wolf's power still burn within you; your remnants of divinity threaten to topple the pantheon.<br><br>Forsake the gods and join the Rising Sun, a heretical sect that defies divine rule. Embrace the anarchic, self-serving ethos of Spider and her seductive avatar.
