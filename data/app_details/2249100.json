{"about_the_game":"<u>Spelltanks</u> is an Action Roguelite where you play as a tank and have complete control over your gun. The main mechanic that we focus on is the gun customization. We want to have as much fun with crazy spell and projectile combinations. <br><br><strong>Projectiles</strong><br>A lot of projectiles in Spelltanks have unique characteristics like homing, oscillating horizontally, curving, BLACKHOLE and much more. These characteristics synergize well with some spells, and some are specifically made to synergize well with some spells. But we put close to no limitations on all the projectiles, so we encourage trying to create custom synergies we didn\u2019t even think about.<br><br><strong>Spells</strong><br>Spells put modifiers on the projectiles. These spells range from simple stat changes to completely crazy behaviors. You can get specific spells from specific enemies as drops, and you can also get random spells from completing summon circles (a summon circles is a beacon that attracts enemies).<br><br><strong>Mana &amp; Health</strong><br>Spells and projectiles both cost mana, each spell has its own mana multipliers/additions. Some spells can also reduce mana costs. Mana constantly regenerates but when you use all your mana you get a mana explosion which causes a small delay before mana can regenerate again, and another delay before you can use mana again. <br>Your health has two values, current health, and scratch health. Every time you get hit your current health goes down the full amount, but your scratch health only goes down for half of the hit. Every enemy drops health orbs on death. These orbs regenerate your current health towards scratch health. But when you have the same amount of current health as scratch health the health orbs will be half as effective, but they can still heal you to your full health.<br><br><strong>Enemies</strong><br>The enemies are the same as the player. They have a projectile and a few spells. These enemies are presets based on the dungeon that you are currently in, and they can be identified by their color. Each color tank has their own preset and behavior, and they can only drop the spells that they have. This results in the possibility to search for specific spells and round out your gun.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1678271333","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1678271333","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1678271333","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2249100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1678271333","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<u>Spelltanks</u> is an Action Roguelite where you play as a tank and have complete control over your gun.
