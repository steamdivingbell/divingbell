{"about_the_game":"Digital Pierrot Museum is a free digital museum presenting the experience of navigating through a museum of digital and multimedia art through a virtual setting. This project is designed to give the audience a live adventure of the whole museum experience. This museum will promote digital art, contemporary art and virtual experiences. The floor plan and the architecture of the museum is devised so the audience can fully immerse in the experience, get lost, and interact. It\u2019s an open virtual space in which multimedia artists can join our vision of making art accessible to everyone. Our goal is to promote art, technology and multimedia and to provide an open space to integrate and incorporate these mediums into the virtual experience of the museum. Using Unity Game engine and VR Virtual Reality Headsets technology to power up the museum experience, we are trying to further enhance the interactivity and the adventure of the museum for purely educational purposes.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676727492","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099240/page.bg.jpg?t=1676727492","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099240/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676727492","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2099240/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676727492","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"VR Only","id":54}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Digital Pierrot Museum is a free digital museum presenting the experience of navigating through a museum of digital and multimedia art through a virtual setting.
