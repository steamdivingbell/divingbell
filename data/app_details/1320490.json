All three of the playstyles earn you rewards! The story is played in <strong>episodes</strong>, much like magical-girl anime, with each lasting between 20 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your chosen playstyle, your skills, and whether you decide to skip dialogue interactions. <strong>Different level goals</strong> keep you on your toes and bring a fresh approach to the match3 genre. <strong>Dialogue options</strong> let you choose how Princess Farmer interacts with her friends, affecting your relationships with them. Make them your BFF and they may reward you with gifts!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320490/extras/steam_desc_banners_story.png?t=1729016598\" /><br><br>Princess Farmer was just an ordinary farmer when one day she woke up under the Gaia Tree. Now through the magic of Mother Gaia, she can hoist up whole rows of veggies with ease to make matches and smash obstacles by herself, in co-op, or even with an AI companion! Something mysterious is happening in the woods and it's your job to puzzle your way to uncover it! You'll learn about the world around you as you talk and build relationships with the loveable characters including: Mother Gaia, Garlic, Shoppe Keeper Rowan, and even BunBot! <br><br><strong>Make combos! Smash rocks!

You can choose to adjust how you approach your strategy to maximize matches, combos, and smashes. Personalize your playstyle: are you an Action Bunny, a Puzzle Bunny, or a Balance between the two? Level goals range from simple (like score, timed, harvest a certain veggie) to challenging (like fulfilling requests, avoiding matching certain veggies, danger areas).  Some levels will pit you up against a (pretty adorable) opponent. But watch out for storms! That's when Grumpy Block shows up to spoil all your harvesting fun!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320490/extras/LevelIntro.gif?t=1729016598\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1320490/extras/steam_desc_banners_features.png?t=1729016598\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play with a Friend</h2>Sure harvesting is fun by yourself, but why not invite a friend?
