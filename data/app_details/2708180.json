{"about_the_game":"In this score attack mini game, navigate through the dark garden carefully and search for your friends. Save as many friends as you can before the evil entity kills you! The amount of friends saved is your highest score. How many of your friends can you save?<br><br>Features include a saved high score! Yeah I know, another one of these on here. Not much to say about gameplay, but its dark so navigate carefully before running into friends.<br><br>Anyways...<br><br>Hello netizens, just a worried mom here that made a mini game for my ten year old daughter and sharing it with the world. She loves video games and loves being in the garden. This mini game I made for her is what she describes as what happens in our garden when friends visit. My daughter always talks about how this monster is always chasing them around. Our garden is openly attached to a forest, so a lot of her neighborhood friends run through it to get home from school.<br><br>My daughter has been upset and extremely sad as of recently due to three people in the area that have gone missing. A mother, the mother's cousin, and the mother's daughter who was my daughter's friend. The main reason why I made this was to keep us distracted from the glooming news. She wanted me to make something where she was the main character that saved everyone from this monster. Vain selfie below, just wanted to show you all who I am and if there are any other moms out there to relate and communicate with.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2708180/extras/Steam_DGZ.png?t=1732936592\" /><br><br>Once again my daughter recently just stood in our garden staring at the forest for hours. She would always scream, telling me the monster was there eating her friend, albeit there was absolutely nothing there. I don't understand, I can't see what she sees nor do I believe her, although I want to. It's all just eerie to me even if I'm playing along. Her behavior is also due to a lack of certain medication which keeps her calm. My job doesn't provide health insurance for us, so I've been buying her meds normally using savings and donations.<br><br>This time I want to give something in return to those who help us. This mini game project was a great bonding experience with my daughter. She illustrated concepts and cemented ideas for me to program. Now that development is complete, she's lost interest in wanting to try it out. She tells me she's too afraid to play it. Although I'm a bit frustrated about her not wanting to, I understand. This project will always be here for her whenever she's ready. Thank you everyone for reading and whatever you can give is appreciated!<br><br>Update: On 10/20/2023 two more people have gone missing in the area. Local detectives have reported difficulty finding any evidence of their location. The fear is infecting my head and my daughter's behavior has gotten uncontrollable. Something horrific is going on that is completely beyond my understanding.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Junji Resident","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2708180/e2c517994ace076c95c4861ec919b152734731c3.jpg"},{"name":"The Silent Evil","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2708180/ad17a114a7f45951916dd31c587aa25d58a9da7a.jpg"},{"name":"The Social Butterfly","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2708180/deff6cdbdbc6ffa8d5f082ab08f0b9cd33384488.jpg"}],"total":3},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2708180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732936592","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2708180/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732936592","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2708180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732936592","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2708180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732936592","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this score attack mini game, navigate through the dark garden carefully and search for your friends.
