{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The protagonist of the story is a chicken that has been living on the top of the canyon. One day, it fell from above. The reason for the fall is unknown. After all, it broke its head and can no longer remember.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fortunately, it can still fly and has a chance to fly back to the top of the canyon, so all you need to do is to help it fly by flapping its wings reasonably. Then find a reasonable route to help it fly back to the chicken coop.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a simple, interesting and thrilling game. The purpose of making it is to make you scream nervously when playing.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The content of the game is very simple. You will play as a chicken and embark on the road to the chicken coop on the top of the canyon. In the game, you only need to control the chicken's wings through the keyboard or mouse buttons. Every time you press the button, the chicken will flap its wings. Then, by flapping its wings, you can make it fly. You only need to control the frequency and timing of flapping wings to stabilize the flight and control the climb and turn. Then fly higher along the correct route, and finally fly to the destination step by step-its chicken coop. It sounds easy here, like a simple flying game, but the actual situation will be very difficult. In addition to maintaining balance and following the correct flight path, you must also try to avoid hitting obstacles, otherwise you may lose your balance and fall from the air.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In addition, there are some hidden contents in the game, I believe you can find them.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3080960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736921845","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3080960/page.bg.jpg?t=1736921845","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3080960/775f0c37211314604c1d664acc9f74b4a77b0689/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736921845","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3080960/775f0c37211314604c1d664acc9f74b4a77b0689/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736921845","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The protagonist of the story is a chicken that has been living on the top of the canyon.
