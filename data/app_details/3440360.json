{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Digipunks 2069 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Digitopia was one of the largest cities. In 2069, its population was in the millions. Its skyline is more impressive than that of other large cities; its metropolis was spread over such vast plains that skyscrapers and apartment buildings could be seen for miles. It was a city full of flying cars, fog, and stubborn digipunks. Its people are such a vivid mixture of races, languages, and colors that they seemed to shine in the lights of the city. The streets were teeming with people on their way to work. As clusters of people walked by, their pace would slow, their stride would lengthen and their eyes would widen, following the shadows cast by the bots.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Life outside the walls of Digitopia was much more brutal, as many struggled to survive. The people of the Wastelands were desperate for access to the advanced augmentation systems, but the high-tech pieces of equipment could only be obtained by the wealthiest of the population. The city members attempted to reign in their rebellious nature and ease their pain by constructing a plan. This was geared towards controlling those who resisted their power and the company. An essential part of this plan was they supplied basic foodstuffs to the people. The bots kept a close eye on these people with a sentry system, recording all data relating to them. Some did not have the technological strength to fight against them, but they still had courage.
