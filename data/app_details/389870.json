To do this Chou Chou can change between a variety of personality type alter-egos. Depending on the kind of person enemies are attracted to (shy, stern, ditzy, aggressive, etc) they will be charmed and join you, or made angrier and more dangerous. The dynamics of attraction are not sexual in tone and are purely comedic in nature.\r\nThe dialog between character contains flirtatious references but no actual sexual content of any sort. Between worlds there are sometimes scenes in a bathhouse where characters are covered by bubbles, etc, and no nudity is ever depicted.\r\n"},"detailed_description":"<strong>Mugen Souls</strong> features a free-roaming battle map, turn-based combat, and massive amounts of customization and growth to maximize the fun players can have with the game. <br><br>Expansive worlds to explore: Travel freely on each world to explore and find treasures and items.

It\u2019s turn based, where you have an area you can move about in and from there a smaller area you can attack in, this gets bigger/smaller for some skills and is fairly similar to a tactical RPG system, but in 3D and it feels a lot less restricted\u2026 The game performs really well too, I\u2019m fairly below the minimum spec, but on the lowest setting I have next to no slowdown in game\u2026
