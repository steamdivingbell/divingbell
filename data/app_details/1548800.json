{"about_the_game":"&quot;<strong>Wizard Of Walls</strong>&quot; is a dungeon/maze shooter with retro mechanics inspired by the old arcade classic &quot;<strong>Wizard Of Wor</strong>&quot;. You play a warrior with a laser gun and have to shoot all monsters. If you touch a monster or get shot by a monster, you die instantly (no health bar, no regeneration). Everything becomes faster and faster. Your goal is to survive as many dungeons as you can.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer local, online and mixed</h2>You can play coop or PvP with up to 4 players. Local multiplayer and online are combinable. For example, you can play together with 2 players on one machine and 2 players on another machine via internet. You can also invite your steam friends or join their lobbies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Power-Ups</h2>Collect power-ups within the dungeon. The blue ones make you run faster, the orange ones make you shoot faster<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spider Dungeons</h2>Every 5th dungeon is a spider dungeon. A horde of fast moving spiders crawl around and try to drop eggs. If you don't shoot the eggs in time, 5 new spiders will be born.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leaderboard</h2>The leaderboard shows the top 100 single player warriors and the top 100 team scores in coop games (for 2, 3 or 4 players)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683380507","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548800/page.bg.jpg?t=1683380507","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683380507","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1548800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683380507","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"&quot;<strong>Wizard Of Walls</strong>&quot; is a dungeon/maze shooter with retro mechanics inspired by the old arcade classic &quot;<strong>Wizard Of Wor</strong>&quot;.
