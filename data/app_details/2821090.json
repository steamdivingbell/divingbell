{"about_the_game":"Develop your strategy, deploy your programs, and defuse enemy viruses in packet.Breach(), an innovative take on the tower defense genre. Unlike most tower defenses where you build towers that passively shoot bullets, you will deploy programs that manipulate and redirect the projectiles of your enemies. Programs are weak in isolation, but incredibly useful when paired strategically. You can even take it one step further and modify the properties of bullets and programs entirely. Utilize emergent strategies to become a hacker legend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Roguelike Deckbuilding:</strong> You have many options at your disposal. You can create a deck focused on teleporting projectiles, creating massive explosions, destroying your own programs, creating a bullet hell, or much much more.<br></li><li> <strong>Powerful Synergies:</strong> Each program has synergies with other programs. Understanding how programs interact with each other is the key to creating a proficient strategy.<br></li><li> <strong>Joinable Hacker Factions:</strong> As you continue to hack, you will gain prestige and gain renown amongst various hacker affiliations. Progress in their ranks (or choose to remain unaffiliated) to gain access new legendary programs with unique effects.<br></li><li> <strong>Procedural Corporate Servers:</strong> Each megacorporation has unique strategies to thwart your efforts. Some may construct digital walls, while others will attempt to destroy your own programs.<br></li><li> <strong>Emergent Mechanics:</strong> packet.Breach() is built with simple gameplay rules that have huge gameplay consequences and implications with other mechanics. Discover mechanics that no other players (or even the developers) know about!</li></ul>","background":"","background_raw":"","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707158717","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2821090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707158717","categories":[{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Develop your strategy, deploy your programs, and defuse enemy viruses in packet.Breach(), an innovative take on the tower defense genre.
