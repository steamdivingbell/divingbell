{"about_the_game":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Impatient","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/c2c9f390489ae9389b7a83d4d751560437ed69f5.jpg"},{"name":"Nuisance to society","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/4ce39196cefcd4c3ec4ff9e354b82244f4fbe37a.jpg"},{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/9a530c592b2175ab7032ee5ff89346a2d8311d6a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Squid","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/6905904731cd802b15ed690dd8df6e12f46eeb20.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Arcade","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/731eebd47753833e6ba3ce6e0ebc08258013050a.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Twisted","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/c68feca174eb3231291a29b44f77ada4d5cd6e61.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Mushroom Forest","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/8c8ee20b599249fef29f4eb91172e21805743399.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Swirls","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/4939de02a9ecc07f602402ff36cb5af1eafa9b91.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Canopy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/9dcfbf5c0e0b6f01853ad545ef53a27673bd9e80.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Village","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1996420/a139c6739b3a5ea9e71397e8ba3daeb92878b755.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737152661","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996420/page.bg.jpg?t=1737152661","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737152661","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1996420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737152661","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\u204d 1000+ bees<br>\u204d 10 unique artworks<br>\u204d Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u204d Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>\u204d Additional bee related objects to find<br>\u204d Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>\u204d Achievements<br>\u204d Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel<br>\u204d 3 save slots<br>\u204d Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\u204d Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
