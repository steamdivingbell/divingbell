{"about_the_game":"Run, jump, shoot, and think your way through 35 levels of technological mayhem in Station Zeta. The station is a deathtrap, the robots are out of control, and the crew is no help at all. It won't be easy, but with a bit of brainpower (and a lot of reflexes), you might just make it out alive. And if you're feeling charitable, you might just save everyone else along the way.<br><br><strong>Welcome to Station Zeta</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2950320/extras/description-logo.png?t=1725050984\" /><br><br>You warned them all.<br><br>As Station Zeta's resident SPOSHA inspector, you've been telling them for months the whole place was one duct tape roll away from falling apart. <br><br>But did anybody listen?<br><br>No, of course they didn't.
