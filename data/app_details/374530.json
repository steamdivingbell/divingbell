{"about_the_game":"Inspired by '90s console classics, DiscStorm's soundtrack fuses modern dance trends with retro chiptunes. Each track is designed to evoke a strong feeling of the arena it's written for using a blend of nostalgic and contemporary synths, whilst still retaining the frantic, fast-paced nature at the game's heart.<br><br>DiscStorm was the first major project I have worked on as either a developer or a musician. I've been writing electronic music since I was a child, so I was thrilled to finally apply it to making a game. Inspired by artists like Bossfight and Zircon, I really wanted to attempt a fusion of old and new, whilst still reflecting the mood associated with each of our game's settings.
