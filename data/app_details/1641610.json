Over 60 minutes of music, including the song \u201cWhere the Wind May Blow'' penned by the acclaimed Alina Lesnik. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet the 18 atmospheric tunes take you to the Louisiana swamps, the blues-filled Chicago, and to the East Coast, where bluegrass, ragtime, and all that jazz will show you what the Gilded Age was all about. And three bonus tracks will also let you feel the magic of the circus show! So, now the only question that remains is\u2026 what are you waiting for? It\u2019s time to put on your rambling shoes and hit the dusty trail - an adventure of a lifetime awaits!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nARTIST: <br />\r\nMusic composed and produced by: Patryk Scelina<br />\r\nRecorded by: Kamil Biedrzycki<br />\r\nMain Guitar / Dobro: Piotr Haie<br />\r\nViolin: Aleksandra Fikus<br />\r\nCello: Micha\u0142 Bie\u0144<br />\r\nHarmonica / Second Guitar / Mandoline: Patryk Scelina<br />\r\nCOMPOSER: Patryk Scelina<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBonus track &quot;Where the Wind May Blow&quot;<br />\r\nMusic composed and produced by: Alina Lesnik","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641610/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1631800226","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641610/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1631800226","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641610/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1631800226","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1641610/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1631800226","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Discover the world of dusty trails and barren wastelands; a world where nature rules and the man isn\u2019t more important than a mere coyote... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Amazing American Circus\u2019s OST is an adventure through the American traditions of country and folk music, where regional and ethnic influences mix and create the musical soundscape of Weird America.
