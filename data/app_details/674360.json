{"about_the_game":"Orb Flo is a puzzle game comprised of a set of prisms and receptacles.  A puzzle is considered solved whenever the orbs flow through all receptacles.  Flow can be altered by toggling a prism on or off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has three different modes: practice, time-trial, and endurance.  In time-trial mode, you are ranked based on how quickly you solve ten puzzles.  In endurance mode, you are ranked by how many puzzles you can solve using a set number of lives.  A life is deducted if you use up too many moves to solve a puzzle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/674360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1507258961","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/674360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1507258961","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/674360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1507258961","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/674360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1507258961","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Orb Flo is a puzzle game comprised of a set of prisms and receptacles.
