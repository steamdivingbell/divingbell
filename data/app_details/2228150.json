{"about_the_game":"<strong>Multiplayer Feature Coming Soon</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Story</strong></h2><br>First of all, you should know that a perilous mission is waiting for you. I think there are some things you should know before starting this mission.<br><br>A boy who lived in this house many years ago invites his friends to the house. Adventure-seeking children want to talk to a deceased relative using the ouija board. But things don't go well. Unfortunately, the person who came with the established connection was not the person they expected. A malevolent soul came to this world with the connection established. The first thing he did as soon as he arrived was to kill those who summoned him. The common views of the psychics who came to examine the house after this event caused this house to be abandoned. The psychics said that an evil soul possessed this house and that he had divided his soul into objects so as not to be destroyed. So this soul is very smart and very dangerous.<br><br>Now you know the story of this house. Let me give you a few more tips. If you enter the house with your team to destroy this soul, this soul will take over the body of the one you. And it will try to prevent you from destroying it by killing you. I told you he was smart and dangerous. In this case, the person you think is from your team can become a soul and kill you. Or you can become a soul and kill your team.<br><br>The last clue I can give you is that the psychics have determined that the evil soul is dividing its soul into the voodoo dolls in the house. What you need to do is to pay attention to those around you while collecting the voodoo dolls at home. Don't be distracted by the corpses you can see while you're trying to complete your quest. Once all the voodoo dolls have been captured, the spirit will perish<br><br>And one last thing. Don't worry about what will happen if you are the chosen one. Remember it wasn't you! Be careful!...<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Single Player Mode</strong></li></ul>Compete against the clock in single-player mode.

If all the voodoo dolls are gone, you're gone too. That's why you have to kill all the people without revealing yourself. Sometimes in the game, there may be different spirits like you.
