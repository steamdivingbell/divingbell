{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">San Francisco, 1946: a chill rainy dead October night. Murder\u2019s afoot, and only Chief Cheese has what it takes to get to the bottom of it. As a World War II veteran, a prophetic crime solver, and a hopelessly romantic dairy product, he knows that sometimes the best cop for the job is a crooked cop. If only his partner weren\u2019t a by-the-book stick of chalk. Experience a psychoanalytical cat-and-mouse, mouse-and-cheese mind game like no other as you break into a house, fall in love with a suspect, hit the sauce, and fire a nuclear bullet at a family pet.
