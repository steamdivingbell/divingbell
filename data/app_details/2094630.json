You have been hired to work as a conversation partner for a lonely aristocrat. It is a profitable opportunity, and your impoverished upbringing and middling university education leave you few others. <br><br>But secrets lurk in every darkened corridor, and nothing is what it seems.

When you reach the end, will you bring justice to those who deserve it, or keep their secrets buried forever? <br><br>And, of course, there is love: midnight trysts, stolen moments, and sweet warmth amid the cold.
