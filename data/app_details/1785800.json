But some platforms also have thorns, some do not hold the cube for more than a few seconds, and some move it in different directions.<br />\r\nThus, you need to balance on the platforms for the maximum amount of time so that the cube stays in order.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1785800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1634886211","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1785800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1634886211","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1785800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1634886211","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1785800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1634886211","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bouncy Cube is an arcade game where you keep the balance of a cube on moving platforms.<br />\r\nThere are thorns at the top of the level and you cannot allow the cube to touch them, for this you need to balance between the platforms moving up.
