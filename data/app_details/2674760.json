{"about_the_game":"In a scenario of apocalyptic desolation, human civilization has become authoritarian and controlled by computer systems and their machines. There was then dissent from people against this regime, and a war began. After that, the Civilized people emerged, people who lived in cities and immersed in the digital system. On the other side, people called Darklands, people who live outside the reach of information systems and cities. However, these people are hunted and persecuted by drones and robots from technological corporations, whose objective is to exterminate the so-called &quot;Darklander Threat&quot;. In this context, in the game you control Raphi McRaven, a cowboy hacker who collects information by circumventing computer systems. And also in the shoes of Suelen Faraday, a young university student who ends up getting involved in this conflict. Darklands is an RPG game divided into chapters, full of secrets, mysteries, suspense and much more. The game is in Portuguese. This game is available in episodes. No amount will be charged beyond the individual game. Episodes will be made available with updates. If you need translation, you can use the Play Store app called Ace Translate to help.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2674760?t=1705759664","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2674760?t=1705759664","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2674760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1705759664","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2674760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1705759664","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In a scenario of apocalyptic desolation, human civilization has become authoritarian and controlled by computer systems and their machines.
