First is cruising over mountains and oceans at blazing speeds in an F-16 while dodging missiles and releasing chaff packets. The second is a far more technical branch of simulators. These products take great pains to reproduce every last physical force on the aircraft bodies, right down to vectored thrust and the effect of directional windspeed on flight times. While the first style is geared toward action lovers, the second has far more appeal to would-be pilots and people who have actual licenses. Each of these styles also has its own representative series which defines its genre based on the crucial differences. Action has the venerable Jetfighter series while realists might prefer something along the lines of Combat Flight Sim 2 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000. Past realistic flight combat games have had one crucial historic element missing.\u201d<br />\r\n80 \u2013 Adrenaline Vault<br
