{"about_the_game":"My name is Jack Ryan. The story of my life began when I joined the elite counterterrorism squad, KodjHound. We were trained in the latest secret technologies, including a treatment called RZDNT LevelUp which enhanced our abilities. However, one of our operatives, Jay Pinkman, became addicted to the treatment and ended up causing a massacre in the area where we were operating.<br><br>After Jay's incident, we tested a new version of the treatment, but it had severe side effects on animals, including cardiac arrest. Soon after, our staff doctor and the only woman in our squad, Alicia, were found dead in the laboratory. It was clear that our squad had been betrayed, and Craig, our most experienced fighter, was the main suspect.<br><br>The remaining 10 members of our squad were ordered to take action against the infected zone, with carte blanche given to us by our direct command. We split into pairs and began our mission, but the connection was lost, and we were left alone to face the zombie horde.<br><br>As we moved further inland, we encountered more problems. We had limited ammunition and had to make difficult decisions, such as shooting surviving civilians to conserve our resources. Eventually, Greg and I were left with almost no rounds left.<br><br>After a container was parachuted onto the top of a building, Greg and I fought our way up to it, only to find it empty. Exhausted and almost hopeless, we decided to rest in a shelter we found. However, Greg became infected and began experiencing severe cramps.<br><br>I knew I couldn't help him, so I left the shelter and continued toward my goal, determined to survive no matter what. I found a walkie-talkie and tried to contact the squad, but with no response. Two days had passed, and I was running out of time.<br><br>As I fought my way through the zombie-infested streets, I realized that this fight was probably useless. But I couldn't give up. With only a couple of injections of the RZDNT LevelUp treatment left, I continued to fight, hoping that someone would find my message and remember our sacrifice.v<br><br><br>-----<br>Player fantasy - SWAT meets zombies in Sanctuary environments.<br><br>\u2022 Fight against zombies, spider mutants &amp; evil soldiers.<br>\u2022 Use different automatic rifles or frag grenades to defeat enemies.<br>\u2022 9 fantastic medieval levels day and night time.<br>\u2022 Collect crystals to activate ZIP lines.<br>\u2022 Travel at ZIP lines to hidden level areas.<br>\u2022 Open treasure chests to collect keys.<br>\u2022 Find and open an exit from the level.<br>\u2022 Interact with other SWAT members.<br>\u2022 Read diaries and reveal the root cause of infection.<br>\u2022 Enjoy unreal engine-powered 3d graphics: 2K textures, lights &amp; shadows, visual and sound effects.<br>\u2022 Have fun.<br><br><br>Input mapping <br><br><br>[W][A][S][D] - Movement<br>[E] - Interaction (ZIP-lines traveling, dairies reading, talking to SWAT)<br>[G] - Frag grenade<br>[F] - Flashlight<br><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> - Game pause<br>[R] - Reload<br>[1] - Primary weapon<br>[2] - Secondary weapon<br>[Space] - Jump<br>[Shift] - Sprint<br>[Left mouse button] - third-person person view firing<br>[Right mouse button] - first-person view firing<br>[TAB] - Switch between third-person/first-person person view<br>[Esc] - Quit the game</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Polyglot","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/6c5168386b87aedca9ebbf66553ba2b7e766d002.jpg"},{"name":"Zombie Starter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/ecdae0b62973644070a30c1977d77b28bf959b53.jpg"},{"name":"Fight Night","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/4fe68442674dda1b141165d603676fd36d5f1f5a.jpg"},{"name":"Don't jump!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/acae5c06e858e1f4d062bbfe59f3ddaa87d16a00.jpg"},{"name":"I hear voices.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/3111071d865b4ab92b2ef094e0d3f9e743b42096.jpg"},{"name":"Where's Altair?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/2074ec5293f5bbef8dc35b60fa568538daedff42.jpg"},{"name":"Ray of light.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/6a4635e03b5c12f3cdaa6b111c35fccb31b9e9d0.jpg"},{"name":"Crossy dungeons.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/2b7a1e879f6734dbcaf8ce11f5b6edb7b5ce7dcd.jpg"},{"name":"Jail breaker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/2d032c54eccba146fbde0f0852e62fbef4319d34.jpg"},{"name":"Last sunset?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1164760/494fd02d2aa792f5ab17c4a4c2ed99c483dd678b.jpg"}],"total":55},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164760/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1677753720","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164760/page.bg.jpg?t=1677753720","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164760/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1677753720","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1164760/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1677753720","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"My name is Jack Ryan.
