Pay attention to details, and you will become an outstanding librarian!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Work time is divided into two parts: the morning and the afternoon.

The information of the reader will appear on the screen on the right. You need to check the information and make sure that they are using their own ID and they have the authorization to borrow. Then you can press the &quot;receipt&quot; button on the bottom of the screen, type in the title of the checked-out book and the return date, and press &quot;print.&quot; Then you can give the printed receipt along with the ID card and the now-checked-out book to the reader.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264440/extras/ID\u5361.gif?t=1729667814\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u3010Hidden\u00a0Messages\u00a0in\u00a0Books\u3011</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you handle many books at the front desk, you will find hidden information in them.
