{"about_the_game":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>The Soviet invasion of Poland occurred in 1939 as a part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. On September 17, 1939, just a few weeks after the German invasion of Poland, Soviet forces crossed the eastern border of Poland. The Soviet incursion aimed to claim territories in eastern Poland, which were historically disputed and had a significant Ukrainian and Belarusian population. The Polish Army was already heavily engaged in fighting the Germans in the west, and the Soviet invasion further divided and weakened Poland. This dual invasion ultimately led to the occupation and disintegration of Poland, with eastern territories incorporated into the Soviet Union and western regions under Nazi German control, illustrating the devastating consequences of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the tragic fate of Poland during the early stages of World War II.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK INFO:</h2><strong>Puzzle Count:</strong> 7<br><strong>Total Piece Count:</strong> 1,778<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK CONTENTS:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>BA-I armoured car in Brest-Litovsk - x330<br></li><li>Crashed Polish PWS-26 trainer aircraft - x216<br></li><li>Polish soldiers escape into Romania - x330<br></li><li>Red Army soldiers handing out propaganda flyers - x330<br></li><li>Russian and German officers discuss partition plans - x216<br></li><li>Soviet forces enter Wilno - x140<br></li><li>Soviet soldiers with disgruntled Polish children - x216</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760949/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695409042","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760949/page.bg.jpg?t=1695409042","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760949/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695409042","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760949/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695409042","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>The Soviet invasion of Poland occurred in 1939 as a part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
