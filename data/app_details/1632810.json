{"about_the_game":"A 2d puzzle platformer game with different mechanics for each world. you don't always have direct control over curses, many of them are triggered by things like falling or dying so enemies can trigger them too. some examples are If you press in a certain area then it triggers all horizontally aligned entities to swap minds and if objects fall fast in a certain area then they explode. Swap minds with enemies, destroy terrain with explosions, create clones and summon gusts of wind to solve puzzles.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1632810/extras/gif.gif?t=1675239428\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1632810/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1675239428","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1632810/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1675239428","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1632810/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675239428","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1632810/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675239428","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A 2d puzzle platformer game with different mechanics for each world. you don't always have direct control over curses, many of them are triggered by things like falling or dying so enemies can trigger them too. some examples are If you press in a certain area then it triggers all horizontally aligned entities to swap minds and if objects fall fast in a certain area then they explode.
