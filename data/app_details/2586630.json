{"about_the_game":"<strong><br>The first independently developed role-playing game targeting all age groups for casual decompression, with a 2D horizontal version, mainly focused on defense and adventure, with storyline tasks, capable of collecting and building, spreading the positive energy of helping others.</strong><br><br>Similar to the controllable character version of 'Radiant Shelter', it does not belong to hardcore platform action games like 'Demon City' and does not have complex control mechanisms or dazzling strike effects.<br>Your positive feedback is the best encouragement for me. If you have any suggestions or need help, please send me an email. Thank you for your understanding and support!<br><br><strong><br>***Please subscribe to the Steam Creative Workshop and successfully download the image resource package before playing the game***<br>The character portraits and scene images of the game can be downloaded from the 'Creative Workshop'<br>Some game controllers have been mapped, please download them in &quot;Controller Settings&quot;</strong><br><br>The game lasts about 12 hours, and the expert level difficulty of unlocking after clearance is about 15 hours.<br>In the later stage, new tasks and characters will be added for free, and creative workshops will also gradually display different styles of vertical drawing image resource packs.<br>When testing the initial version of the game, I didn't think it was very difficult and added expert level challenges. Now, after these two difficulty adjustments, the overall difficulty has dropped to less than 70% of what it was during testing. I feel like the normal mode has become an unchallenged unparalleled game.<br>Attached is a guide. If you find it difficult, you can start from the following aspects:<br>1. At the beginning, purchase the medicine from the two shopping machines outside the shelter and receive a few complimentary potions<br>2. After withstanding the first wave of attacks, you can go to low-level areas in the wilderness to collect supplies<br>3. Priority should be given to using back and forth health from sleep during non combat situations, and purchased food and medicine should be used in the wild for quick recovery during combat<br>4. When experience is about to level up, do not pick experience pills on the ground. Wait until the health level reaches its bottom before picking, and do not pick blood bottles when they are full of health<br>5. Weapons and equipment will only retain the current equipment and those used at the next level, and the remaining will be exchanged for money<br>6. Do not sell materials easily unless the shelter upgrade is completed. Merchants can also purchase large quantities of materials to speed up the game process<br>7. In the middle and later stages, animals and plants can be raised, and dishes can be made to bring back blood. The rescued refugees can also provide considerable income<br>8. Pets can block in front of them. Walk up to them first, then turn back a bit. Within a certain range, they won't follow. When they have residual health, they can pass it to the second floor, but they won't follow them down. When their health is full, they can pass it back to their side to save resurrection money<br>9. When the enemy attacks, stand on the first wall of the shelter, which will block some damage. In addition, if teammates block it, when all the health is depleted, charge up and fight against the monsters<br>10. When fighting monsters, individual slow-moving monsters can run with just one hit, and flying kites can be harmless. When dealing with long-range monsters, simply put them in the fight and chop them from behind. At this point, the pet's position will form a pincer attack with you<br>11. The effect of long-range weapons is not as good as melee weapons. In the early stages, long guns, medium clubs, and later swords are used, and bullets are only kept in rifles. It is recommended to sell the rest<br>12. If you are short of money, you can level low and produce a large amount of minerals. If you are short of weapons, you can defeat levels mainly focused on humans and trolls<br>13. For each level that the player advances by about 5 levels, there will be good treasure chests to be cleared, which can be cleared in approximately 3
