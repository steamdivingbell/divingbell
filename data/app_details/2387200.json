{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Final Front is a team-based first-person shooter that places less emphasis on individual skill and focuses more on your ability to devise, communicate, and execute strategies against your opponents.

Travel to diverse settings and  tactically place your base structures, keeping in mind the unique characteristics of each location. In some cases, you will even be able to deform the landscape yourself.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environmental Destruction</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Battle on worlds where you can cause massive craters in the landscape of a verdant plain, blast holes in the sides of buildings in a dense city, or create a trench system in thick magma, among other possibilities.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inflict lasting destruction on your enemies' vehicles, their structures, and many other objects found in the game.

You could create strictly defensive setups to guard against a weak front while buying your forces time to siege the enemy. You could build up a bulwark of orbital strike guns to prevent the movement of the other team's StarForts. You could make a quick forward base that could provide a literal &quot;jumping off point&quot; for invasion. Or, you could construct something completely unexpected for the situation, among an endless number of possibilities. The choice is yours.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collaborative Strategy</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It's not enough to simply have a great idea. You also have to be able to explain it to others and convince them of its merits. While this is true in general, it's emphasized in The Final Front. The actions of the powerful StarForts stationed in orbit above you are determined based on democracy. The members of your team can choose to vote on any action they feel would be best and that action will be carried out after a few minutes.
