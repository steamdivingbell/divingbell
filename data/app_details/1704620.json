{"about_the_game":"Pilot one of the most unique fighter jets ever made in three challenging, \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. Start each mission with a review of your flight plan, targets, and orders, then select your armaments and jet into intense, realistic combat from either an aircraft or forward air base. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1992 the team behind Harrier Jump Jet created military scenarios around contemporary global flash points. The result is three fascinating, 10-day campaigns in the Falklands, Hong Kong, and Finland. The Hong Kong campaign pits the RAF\u2019s GR5/7 against a variety of little seen Chinese fighters, including the Jian-6 and Shenyang J-8 \u201cFinback.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game development team put significant effort into achieving realism, with extra emphasis on modeling the Harrier\u2019s vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. They had working sessions with experienced Harrier combat pilots and engineers at the Royal Airforce Station Wittering (RAF Wittering). RAF Wittering -- known as the \u201cHome of the Harrier\u201d -- is the main operating base and headquarters for the RAF A4 Force.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are an air combat simulation fan, Harrier Jump Jet should have a place in your collection.
