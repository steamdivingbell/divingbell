{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Journey through the dark ruins of The Last Aura</h2>In this action puzzle game, you must traverse labyrinths laden with obstacles and traps. Set on floating ruins tainted by the dark, your only source of light in the face of obscurity is your own.

The Auras were tasked with containing the darkness but ultimately failed in their roles as keepers. Demilux is now the sole survivor of the once thriving civilization of Auras and must now endure their fate and restore the balance between light and dark.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A full-length dark and horror adventure with surprising boss fights</h2>Play through 15 levels featuring memorable boss fights. Defeat Maynos, the god of illusions, Amatus, the god of hatred, Lyssa, the fanatic goddess and other shadow forces. Avoid their powers and traps by resolving puzzles, exploring the maze, finding power-ups, teaming up with allies and rely on the few light sources that remain in the eternal darkness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A stunning art direction, meticulous from the rich soundtrack to the ambient lighting</h2>Every detail was crafted with the intent of creating a truly immersive dark and atmospheric experience. Players are encouraged to play the game alone at night with earphones to live a horrific adventure.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/985600/extras/The_Last_Aura_Demilux_light_dark_ambient_small.jpg?t=1563326149\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An experience with powerful new gameplay mechanics</h2><u>Aura</u><br>The player character (Demilux) has a blue aura underneath him. This aura represents the amount of light essence your character has and his life total. As your character\u2019s light essence diminishes over time, the aura under him will get smaller and his light will begin to dim. Once your light is completely faded, it\u2019s game over and you will have to restart the stage from the beginning. In order to keep your light from going out, Demilux can pick up light prisms that will replenish his light essence.<br><br><u>Movements</u><br>Players control Demilux exclusively using the mouse; To move your character, move your mouse cursor in the direction you want Demilux to move; The further away from Demilux your cursor is, the faster he moves in that direction.<br><br><u>Light Surge</u><br>By holding the left mouse button Demilux\u2019s movement speed is increased. This ability, known as the light surge not only serves to move faster but also allows your character to break through certain obstacles and avoid certain traps. Watch out though, using this ability comes at the cost of your character\u2019s light essence (life) and should be used conservatively.<br><br><u>Diminishing Light</u><br>By holding the right mouse button, Demilux\u2019s movement speed is slowed down. Slowing down your character\u2019s movement makes it possible to sneak past certain obstacles that would otherwise harm Demilux. As an added effect, diminishing light reduces the light essence used up over time while the ability is active. When your character nears death, this ability can give you the extra inch needed to get to the next light prism in time and replenish your health.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Unavoidable End","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/6e5e3415dec8b8263730812da8ab8c1a6b8f7ba5.jpg"},{"name":"Together As One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/245cddd26b335da13f6bf2de60e1dbc1fa65eed2.jpg"},{"name":"First Dance with Darkness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/3e63e1ebf467509c2a363c883f88b8b53863ac09.jpg"},{"name":"Outrun the Beast of Hatred","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/5345ccc8406ecdf9009f1ee485d19789323d97ce.jpg"},{"name":"Break the Already Broken","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/b6a16223ee92900f6a13ca03a796d79ec66ecfe9.jpg"},{"name":"Outthink the Tinkerer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/40d8863f939e54925efb45a081fac9ef09824eed.jpg"},{"name":"The Apprentice becomes the Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/6b0eac3c75acd065ee1e37c4776056220c985a30.jpg"},{"name":"A Forgotten Light?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/9212566a8a0b1910820acb665f66704d3d7775e6.jpg"},{"name":"Always Charged","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/aebac1118b1c556924388bfd3f2504b5f728f0e5.jpg"},{"name":"Memories of a Lost Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/985600/5aaa9cf3564bc3213f7270b3db22d65c47a8d0c5.jpg"}],"total":14},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/985600?t=1563326149","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/985600?t=1563326149","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/985600/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1563326149","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/985600/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1563326149","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Journey through the dark ruins of The Last Aura</h2>In this action puzzle game, you must traverse labyrinths laden with obstacles and traps.
