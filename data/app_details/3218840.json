{"about_the_game":"Here is the English version of the description for &quot;Dungeon Overdose&quot;:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Dungeon Overdose**  <br />\r\nA Roguelike Command Battle Dungeon RPG<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Title Meaning**  <br />\r\nThe title &quot;Dungeon Overdose&quot; is a coined phrase that combines dungeon crawling with the concept of overdose. It symbolizes how adventurers, as well as players themselves, are gradually drawn into the irresistible allure of the dungeon, unable to stop. This notion of &quot;overdose&quot; lies at the heart of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Main Game Features**  <br />\r\nPlayers have a set number of &quot;lives,&quot; and when these reach zero, it's game over. As long as you have lives, you can revive after a party wipe by consuming one. Lives can be acquired from rare enemy drops, treasure chests, or card packs, allowing players to continue their adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Random Dungeon Stages**  <br />\r\nA randomly generated 100-floor dungeon awaits. Special stages like bonus rooms and monster houses can also be randomly encountered, adding variety to the exploration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Random Allies**  <br />\r\nAllies can only be recruited through events randomly placed throughout the dungeon. This means every attempt at clearing the dungeon requires fresh strategies with new members, ensuring that each challenge feels unique and engaging.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Random Events**  <br />\r\nDungeon exploration is presented in a side-scrolling 2D view. Randomly triggered events provide new choices for the player, expanding the depth of exploration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Random Drops and Card System**  <br />\r\nEnemies drop four types of items, including rare treasures, life cards, and unique monster cards. Card packs can be obtained from treasure chests or as monster drops, with each pack containing three cards from a pool of 60 different cards. Cards can evolve, making even low-rarity cards essential throughout the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**KAI-GAN System**  <br />\r\nDuring command battles, characters\u2019 stats can randomly increase when certain actions are performed. These increases accumulate as hidden &quot;levels.&quot; With chain reactions of these stat boosts, known as &quot;KAI-GAN Chains,&quot; further enhancements or special effects may be triggered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Overdose System**  <br />\r\nIn the dungeon, an infinite flow of magical energy allows the use of spells and techniques without consuming MP, but it comes with a catch: an increasing overdose rate. When the overdose rate reaches 100%, a severe debuff is applied. However, by consuming a life, this debuff can be converted into a powerful buff. Managing your overdose rate during battles is key to survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy utilizing the KAI-GAN System, Overdose System, and Life System, players will gather allies and cards, and delve into the 100-floor dungeon to defeat or seal the final boss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**A Game Full of Compelling Features and Endless Replayability!**  <br />\r\n&quot;Dungeon Overdose&quot; offers players constant new discoveries and challenges. Its myriad random elements ensure that no two playthroughs are the same, providing fresh strategies and thrilling experiences each time.
