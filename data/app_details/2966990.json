Luckily, your first encounter is with a short blue fox that seems to have the hook up. Able to get you a place to stay and even a new job as you wait. This, much like the inhabitants of the world, is something more than what first comes to eye. As you meet new people and learn what exactly you're being set up for, you'll be forced to choose who's allegiance you stand for. Even if that is mainly for one other person than group.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966990/extras/store3.png?t=1718721801\" /><br><br>At first, you'll be restricted on what you can do. Exploring and finding about the little part of the city you stay at, but as you progress further in the story, so too does your freedom along with others. What starts out as you learning about the world and meeting new people, will evolve into you changing yourself to fit the occasion. Whether it's changing your looks for the right guy to be interested in you or people to give you the time of day. The way you fight so you can stand a chance against something you're dragged in to. Or just to do it so you can see that something special only a certain few can, you won't be leaving this world the same way you came into it.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966990/extras/store4.png?t=1718721801\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718721801","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966990/page.bg.jpg?t=1718721801","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718721801","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2966990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718721801","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"Summoned By Accident contains furry (anthropomorphic) males.
