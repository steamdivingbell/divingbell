{"about_the_game":"Experience complex operations out of the iconic Dresden Hbf, with commuters and international travellers converging to make a hustle and bustle mix of S-Bahn, regional, inter-city and freight traffic. Be in control of modern traction, and explore the countryside of Train Sim World 2: Rush Hour - Nahverkehr Dresden. Feel the rush with brand new passengers. As you travel from station-to-station you will see a greater variety in passengers and higher passenger volumes at peak times. All recreating the hustle and bustle of Rush Hour.<br><br>Dating back to the 1830s, the line between Dresden and Riesa was one of Germany\u2019s first long-distance railways. Today the line\u2019s importance keeps it busy, fast services beat the regional traffic through the use of separate fast and slow lines that each take a different path through the Saxony countryside, and the outskirts of Dresden are served by frequent commuter services.<br><br>It\u2019s your job to take control of the services on this line; see two different views out the windscreen as you take on the challenges of regional, S-Bahn and freight services with the DB BR 442, BR 143, BR 146.2 BR 363 and MRCE BR 185.5, plus take control of IC and ICE services with the BR 406 ICE 3M and DB BR 101 (available separately). Take in the route at all hours; when the sun sets, reflective signage and atmospheric lighting bring the night to life.<br><br>Choose how you want to play; drive trains, ride around as a passenger, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold. Create your own experiences with the Scenario Planner and Livery Designer.
