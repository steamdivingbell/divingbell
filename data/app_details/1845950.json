The new revamped version of the Albino Hunter is here to stay!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this Turn-Based RPG, Kalymn Nox returns as the Albino Hunter (as in the hunter with albinism, not some jerk who hunts albinos); even his pretentious and slightly racist title can keep him from waking up broke after a night of drinking. In this exploration-encouraging world, join Kalymn as he finds and takes on various jobs throughout the land which include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Spontaneous Engagement<br />\r\n-A Telepathic Lizard<br />\r\n-A Witch with a Poorly Insulated Castle<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd hey!
