Surprising town customisation that makes it feel that little more like your own game. Another bright and cheery game.\u201d<br>71% \u2013 Brutal Gamer<br><br>\u201cI enjoyed every minute of Ginger: Beyond the Crystal. The level and world design are fantastic. When playing Ginger: Beyond the Crystal it just feels like you are playing one of the good 3D platformers from the 1990s and 2000s. If you don\u2019t really care for platformers or insist on being challenged, Ginger: Beyond the Crystal may not be for you. If you miss the days of the cartoon 3D platformer though, I think you will love Ginger: Beyond the Crystal.\u201d<br>4/5 \u2013 Geeky Hobbies<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_0b67e3613ee28194506265f197e16766e3be05ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_0b67e3613ee28194506265f197e16766e3be05ca.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_ef4ab99234d4b272b664645877c51cbfdc50b921.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_ef4ab99234d4b272b664645877c51cbfdc50b921.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_e432cf37d6f50a778003b3de35da04e7265200c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_e432cf37d6f50a778003b3de35da04e7265200c5.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_1a3ba79a7c1cb99cd604386251a4e05cb20278da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_1a3ba79a7c1cb99cd604386251a4e05cb20278da.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_a4135352d5a3ff1732202598eb691b0e7e5c3733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_a4135352d5a3ff1732202598eb691b0e7e5c3733.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_e7850760f53a85c71b647b0ee5ed1df395b7c624.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_e7850760f53a85c71b647b0ee5ed1df395b7c624.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_9eca886b9e95d4290bfddde7d17e6384f23bd7e1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_9eca886b9e95d4290bfddde7d17e6384f23bd7e1.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_e8da360972cde6dd9bba58ebb3c3fedbb921f2cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1575301898","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/409520/ss_e8da360972cde6dd9bba58ebb3c3fedbb921f2cd.600x338.jpg?t=1575301898"}],"short_description":"Ginger: Beyond the Crystal is an adventure platformer in which you have to rebuild and restore balance to a world devastated by the explosion of a mystical crystal.
