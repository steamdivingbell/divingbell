{"about_the_game":"You find yourself lost in the middle of nowhere. The only way to leave is to refuel your car. But to do so, you'll have to venture into this desolate forest to find a way to unlock the gas station. But, every bit of flesh in your body screams that you are not alone...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you embark on your journey into the forest, you will be equipped with both a flashlight and a camera. The latter is indispensable for your expedition, as it can capture infrared light, revealing hidden entities beyond the reach of your naked eye. However, amidst these extraordinary phenomena, a malevolent entity lurks. This entity becomes increasingly hostile as you draw closer to discovering the way into his church. Unfortunately, your only chance of survival lies within his church. Therefore, the closer you get to opening the church's door, the more cautious you must become. Nonetheless, there are ways to slow down this entity, and furthermore, there are ways to eliminate it. It all depends on your determination and courage to discover them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINFRARED is a survival horror first-person game with a PSX/PS1 style. The game doesn't save progress, which means you only have one chance to complete it, or you will have to restart from the beginning.<br />\r\nThe game features three endings: a good ending, a bad ending, and a secret ending. We recommend setting aside one hour for each playthrough to achieve each of the endings and fully experience the entire game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game also adjusts certain graphical settings (frames per second) during gameplay to create a specific atmosphere.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Good Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2614700/63ca7396ce9a59d3d103cc9cde3e0d897fa66190.jpg"},{"name":"Secret Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2614700/66b7da488c6497f1e7cda6d18acc675002e75d49.jpg"},{"name":"Lore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2614700/1d3fffbba6f3fdd8ef3f74a9f6e1ad65d4f6678b.jpg"},{"name":"Bad Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2614700/7fb91a111a9c26f320dbade139dfc0f850894afe.jpg"}],"total":4},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698421046","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698421046","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698421046","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2614700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698421046","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Occasional appearance of low-poly blood in specific areas."},"detailed_description":"You find yourself lost in the middle of nowhere.
