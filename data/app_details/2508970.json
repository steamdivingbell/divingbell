{"about_the_game":"Misled Madness is a side-scroller platforming game where the player is attempting to complete deadly obstacle courses and survive with their life as the grand prize. In the game, the player will be able to jog, sprint, jump, wall jump, and die.... a lot. The current obstacles the player must avoid include circular saw blades, Pendulum styled swinging axes and spikes scattered around the courses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the casual player can play just for fun to avoid obstacles, more competitive players have the ability to speed run through the levels and gain a ranking on global leaderboards in an attempt to have the fastest times per course. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player is also able to customize their character to give a more personalized feeling when playing the game. Camera settings allow the player to adjust their view to better suit their preferred playstyle.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714084196","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508970/page.bg.jpg?t=1714084196","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508970/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714084196","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508970/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714084196","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The player will constantly be subjected to various hazards that kill the player and spray blood and dismember the player's body in a non-realistic fashion."},"detailed_description":"Misled Madness is a side-scroller platforming game where the player is attempting to complete deadly obstacle courses and survive with their life as the grand prize.
