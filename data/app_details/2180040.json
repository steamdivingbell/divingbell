{"about_the_game":"Legacy's Allure is a customizable, card-based wargame with no randomness. Imagine chess but with customization, deeper mechanics, and a high-fantasy theme. Legacy's Allure has been called a &quot;streamlined wargame&quot; due to its elegance and accessibility.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach player begins the game by drafting an army of an agreed upon size from their deck, also known as a &quot;kingdom&quot;. Then players alternate taking turns in which they may perform a single action with one of their units: moving, attacking, or using an ability. After a unit acts, it is exhausted until the end of the round and cannot act again. Once all units on the board are exhausted, they are refreshed and a new round begins. The game ends at the end of the seventh round. At that time, the attacking player wins if they occupy the central hex with one of their units. Otherwise, the defending player wins.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710887010","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180040/page.bg.jpg?t=1710887010","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180040/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710887010","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2180040/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710887010","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Legacy's Allure is a customizable, card-based wargame with no randomness.
