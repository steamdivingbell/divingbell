{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience Portals In A Whole New Dimension</h2>Warp Lab brings seamless 3D portal mechanics to VR for the very first time. The game uses a unique system that allows for player controlled portals that have true immersive depth. This system allows players to interact with portals in ways that were never before possible. Reach through to interact with objects, or peak in to get the drop on enemies from behind cover, then jump all the way through once the coast is clear. These types of groundbreaking interactions make for a truly unique and exhilarating gameplay experience.<br><br><br>The game's 10 diverse and detailed levels are designed specifically to take full advantage of the portal system. They require a combination of puzzle solving, combat, and physics experimentation to complete. Objectives can be approached in a number of different ways, giving you the freedom to play the way you want. Each level also holds a number of secrets to be discovered, which culminate in extra content at the end of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Immersive 3D player controlled portals<br></li><li>10 unique puzzle &amp; combat levels<br></li><li>Physics sandbox mode allows for unlimited experimentation<br></li><li>Arena mode lets your take full advantage of portals in combat situations<br></li><li>Compete for spots on the global leaderboards</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1838730?t=1670960574","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1838730/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1670960574","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1838730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1670960574","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1838730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1670960574","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience Portals In A Whole New Dimension</h2>Warp Lab brings seamless 3D portal mechanics to VR for the very first time.
