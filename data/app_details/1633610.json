{"about_the_game":"The Super Size Content Pack certainly lives up to its name, with four huge off-road machines ready to take on all terrain and all challengers. First up, our cover star: the Bentley Continental GT Ice Racer. Don\u2019t be fooled by the name \u2013 whilst this Ice Racer will indeed be right at home on sub-zero surfaces at New York, Norway, and Nepal, this 626bhp monster will tear up all surfaces in DIRT 5 on its 22-inch rims; a perfect blend of class and performance, taken to the extreme.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1633610/extras/DLC3BentleyGIF.gif?t=1626771202\" /><br><br>Whilst the Bentley joins the Rally GT class, the Armada Rock Racer is our second entry to DIRT 5\u2019s monstrous Rock Bouncer class.
