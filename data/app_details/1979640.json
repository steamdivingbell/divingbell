{"about_the_game":"There's no rush. Just take a leisurely stroll through beautiful and surreal forests that look like paintings come alive. 7Groves is a relaxing game of exploration and walking simulator.

Along the way, you'll collect items and complete puzzles to explore the furthest reaches of the game and experience all seven dream-like worlds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7Groves is a labour of love and started life as a graphics demo that was meant to have 3d worlds look like 2d paintings. I've had a lot of comments that the game looks like it has been AI generated, but it is not. The painterly effects are achieved with loads of deferred lights, the creative use of textures as well as tons of post processing, including real-time Kuwahara filters. I hope you enjoy wandering about these pretty -entirely human generated- forests as much as I enjoyed making them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Explore 7 strange worlds<br />\r\n- Enjoy beautiful 3d graphics that look like impressionistic paintings that have come alive<br />\r\n- Collect and puzzle to unlock all areas of the game<br />\r\n- Listen to gorgeous choral soundtracks tailored to the game's environments","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979640/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717171286","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979640/page.bg.jpg?t=1717171286","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979640/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717171286","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979640/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717171286","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"There's no rush.
