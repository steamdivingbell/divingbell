During one of their expeditions they met a cute puppy and named him Marty. Since then he has always traveled with them and is passionate about adventure and digging. <br><br>While hunting down a mysterious artifact called the Heart of Space, Clara suddenly disappeared. Exhausted from searching, Christopher returned to camp, where his faithful friend Marty was looking for him. Heartbroken, the experienced adventurer almost gave up on archaeology.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216300/extras/Dog.gif?t=1607458740\" /><br><br>But Marty noticed that his friend was sad, so he became courageous and went alone to look for Clara. The dog found an ancient map with the words &quot;Heart of Space\u201d and something resembling a portal on it. He brought the map to Christopher, which made him excited. <br><br>Plucking up their courage, Christopher and Marty decided to finish what they'd started and find the portal to the Heart of Space. Who knows? Maybe this ancient artifact will help them find out what happened to Clara.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1216300/extras/6.png?t=1607458740\" /><br><br>About the game:<br>The gameplay combines the genres of digger and platformer.
