{"about_the_game":"Party Fowl is a new type of party game that turns your body into the controller. Whether you\u2019re a spring chicken or a seasoned turkey, you\u2019ll have around the cluck fun in a series of flat-out absurd but incredibly entertaining AR mini-games. Try to best your opponent in this ultimate showdown of utter ridiculousness. <br><br>Only the Silliest Shall Prevail.<br><br><strong>Your Body Is the Controller.</strong><br><br>Party Fowl uses your device\u2019s camera to put you and your opponent inside the game. Fly a helicopter with your hips, squat to lay an egg, and flap your wings to feed a chicken.<br><br><strong>Simple to Set Up.</strong><br><br>Party Fowl is also super simple to set up. Just set your device down so that you and your opponent are visible in the front-facing camera. For a more immersive experience, screencast your device to a TV using Airplay or HDMI.<br><br><strong>Compete In 20+ Mini-games.</strong><br><br>With a large collection of mini games that\u2019s constantly expanding, everyone has a chance to reign supreme or make a total fool of themselves. Each game is as goofy and chaotic as the next. Whether it\u2019s Cat Stack, Viking Volleyball or Cookie Catastrophe, Party Fowl has something for everyone! <br><br><strong>As Fun to Watch As It Is to Play.</strong><br><br>Party Fowl was created with three main objectives in mind: Get you moving, make you laugh, and provide you, your friends, and your family with an outlet to let loose and embrace your silliest selves. Win, lose, or draw, the laughter and memorable moments is what this game is all about.<br><br>*Video input or webcam is required.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1932340?t=1667865748","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1932340?t=1667865748","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667865748","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1932340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667865748","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Party Fowl is a new type of party game that turns your body into the controller.
