{"about_the_game":"Four years in the making, Get in the Car Loser! Original Sound Version lays the backdrop for Sam, Grace, Valentin and Angela's adventures in the Kingdom Under Heaven, as they road-trip to prevent the Machine Devil's resurrection. Drawing from a variety of genres, textures and styles, the soundtrack seeks to convey a lineage of JRPG music that extends beyond any one company, taking inspiration from Yuzo Koshiro, Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, Naoshi Mizuta and Tsukasa Masuko, among countless others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a tilt towards Fusion Jazz, Blues Rock, and a pinch of Goth for good measure, Get in the Car Loser! Original Sound Version builds on the sound established in &quot;Welcome to the Fantasy Zone,&quot; expanding on the compositional techniques established there while branching out into more pop-oriented structures. The addition of exhilarating lead/background vocals by Jami Lynne (clover &amp; sealife) adds a new dimension to Lee's sound, and live-performed instrument parts inject it with a fresh dynamism.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1632333361","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759530/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1632333361","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759530/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1632333361","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1759530/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1632333361","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Four years in the making, Get in the Car Loser!
