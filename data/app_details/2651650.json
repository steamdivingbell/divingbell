{"about_the_game":"Outer Factory is a peaceful and minimalist simulation in which you work for a rising industrial concern. As a technical manager, you build fully automated factories and infrastructures on different planets, with the freedom to choose how you construct and when you expand.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Design automated factories</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2651650/extras/basicfactory.gif?t=1701711359\" /><br>You start on a small planet with only a few resources. Build your first machines to extract and process raw materials. Place storage facilities to stockpile supplies. Use assemblers to produce products of varying complexity. Automate all processes, including delivery, by chaining your machines together.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take full control of your production flow</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2651650/extras/controlit.gif?t=1701711359\" /><br>Use magnetic tubes to connect machines. Products will always flow in one direction (from machine output to next machine input). The intelligent logistics systems automatically ensure that only materials which can be used by connected machines are passed on. By using filters, you can control the flow of goods even more precisely.
