{"about_the_game":"Alone and Unafraid, these Species have learned to survive on their own.  An Apex Predator adds a Carnivore and massive Size, but is unable to attack small Species.  AntiSocial Species refuse to join the group and find their own Food where the herd doesn't go.  A Carnivore may attack Quills once, but will never make that mistake again.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReady to mix things up at the Watering Hole?  Promo Cards are additional traits beyond the base set that introduce new dynamics into Evolution. <br />\r\nIn a balanced ecosystem, each new Trait impacts all other Traits as well.  Explore new strategies to survive against creatures using these mighty traits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can add any combination of these cards to singleplayer games, or make your own deck for Pass &amp; Play and Private games.  You can also add one to public multiplayer games, which is then added into the combined deck everyone plays from.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904700/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1693410836","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904700/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1693410836","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904700/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1693410836","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904700/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1693410836","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Alone and Unafraid, these Species have learned to survive on their own.
