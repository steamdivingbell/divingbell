{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>the Wizardz Dugeon</strong></h2></h2>A small game with many elements of a rogue-like. It's about you, a magician who has been robbed of his magic power. The power came from a powerful magical orb which was stolen. Your mission is now to go after the thief's and try to get the orb back. As you enter the dungeon, you strangely feel how your power starts to return. This is where the fun starts. You now have to hack n slash your way through a dungeon trying to gain power without loosing much hp to be able to defeat the guardian later. This game is still under development so the first release of the game will be an Alpha version of the game. This game is inspired by Wizard of Legends, The Binding of Isaac and Dead Cells.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1829250?t=1671822804","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1829250?t=1671822804","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1829250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1671822804","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1829250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1671822804","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>the Wizardz Dugeon</strong></h2></h2>A small game with many elements of a rogue-like.
