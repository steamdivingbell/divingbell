{"about_the_game":"<i>Reality Mixer</i> lets you bring real objects into VR. It uses the cameras on the headset to show a real object and its surroundings in the current VR environment.

Use this activation method with seated games where you have things on a table next to your seat. The activation angle and optional activation delay can be configured.
