According to the legend, whenever hunger and disaster strike, the &quot;Chicken God&quot; will reappear in the human world. With his exquisite and unparalleled cooking skills, he will feed the citizens of Gugu repeatedly and quell the disasters time and time again. However, as time passed, the power of the 'Chicken God' gradually weakened, and the gluttonous monsters hidden in another dimension began to stir again. In response to the upcoming crisis, the 'Chicken God' used its last strength to send a mysterious message to all parallel worlds that only the 'Kun Clan' could accept.
