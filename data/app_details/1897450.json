{"about_the_game":"<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A digital version of the iconic U-BOOT The Board Game. </h2></strong><br>Manage the crew of a powerful warship during World War II. Explore enemy territory, win battles using the strength of a steel giant and reliable tactics, and most importantly - overcome the blue abyss.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lead the war effort</h2>In the claustrophobic iron coffin that is the deck of a U-Boat, the most important thing is to keep your cool. Manage your crew: captain, officers, mechanics and navigators. Give orders, destroy enemy vessels and don't let your own ship sink. Use torpedo attacks and weapons of various calibres.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Develop a plan</h2>Carry out the missions assigned to you. Complete side quests to gain additional experience. Develop strategies and make good use of the resources at your disposal. Take risks, but also be aware of the consequences. It is up to you to make the most of your crew's potential.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Look after your crew</h2>It's not easy to stay mentally healthy while trapped underwater, knowing that every day could be your last. Look after your crew's morale, their wellbeing and safety. Prepare meals for them, treat their wounds, manage the watch system and don't forget that every seafarer needs rest too. Decide whether the success of the mission or the wellbeing of your seafarers is more important.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Think analytically</h2>Conduct tactical operations in real time. Think carefully about every order you give and the cost you will incur for it. Deal with random events and difficulties you encounter on your way. Remember that nothing is impossible at sea, and you must act quickly and without hesitation if you want the mission to succeed.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1897450?t=1736946718","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897450/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1736946718","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736946718","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1897450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736946718","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Check this out</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A digital version of the iconic U-BOOT The Board Game. </h2></strong><br>Manage the crew of a powerful warship during World War II.
