{"about_the_game":"Dungeon of Astaroth is a casual puzzle game that draws you into a world of magic and intrigue. <br><br>You start as a powerless mage, but as you progress, you'll gain magical skills, and the puzzles will evolve from physical mechanics to challenges where magic becomes truly necessary. However, you cannot kill, nor can any enemy die - if they perish, you die and must restart the level. Be observant of your surroundings. Everything you need will always be provided in the room you currently are in.<br><br>The game contains 120 joyful levels to complete. Within this collection, you'll find special levels that play by entirely different rules, providing mechanics completely unlike the rest of the game. These standout stages offer a refreshing change of pace amid the regular puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Storyline</h2>In this realm, several powerful clans wield mystical forces:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The Chronos: Specializing in space and time manipulation.<br></li><li> The Arcanum: Masters of elemental magic, each family member specializes in controlling a specific element like fire, water, air, or earth.<br></li><li> The Shadowweavers: Proficient in dark magic, known for their illusion and manipulation magic, adept at creating intricate illusions and altering perceptions.</li></ul><br>The Auramancers are capable of absorbing and manipulating various magical auras and energies from these lineages. Astaroth, the last of their kind and by far the most formidable, now seeks to harness the Shadowweavers' forbidden dark arts. His quest leads him into the devil's cave, where legend speaks of an extraordinarily powerful Shadowweaver is located.<br><br>You are the next Auramancer, born of a Chronos clan. When your father left to find Astaroth for help with your training, he didn't realize the serious danger coming. Chronos couples cannot be apart for a long time before one starts failing... and now your mother grows weaker every day.<br><br>You take up the quest to find your father after three months missing, determined to save her before time runs out.
