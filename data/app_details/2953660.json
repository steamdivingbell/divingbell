{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Amazing Curves Racing</i> (<strong>ACR</strong>) is a single- and online multi-player racing simulator featuring advanced physics working directly on bicubic polynomial 3D curved surfaces. The physics engine was designed for network play from the start: lag is well hidden. The tire model provides realistic driving dynamics, including at high speed and on rapidly varying road surfaces, where driving aids can provide an easier or more challenging experience based on driver preferences. Computational Fluid Dynamics are used for realistic airflow modeling, providing for low to very high downforce driving experiences. 3D sound in addition to the HUD map provides helpful feedback for other car locations.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ACR</strong> typically loads levels in under 3 seconds, where the design philosophy is <i>Minimize Waiting</i>. Starting a single or multiplayer player race as well as joining a multiplayer race takes just a few seconds. When a multiplayer race is started, other racers can join immediately by taking over one of the AI driver's positions: no waiting. The racer's car model and custom settings replaces the AI car.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <i>Turbo-Reset</i> feature helps make online play more fun: crashing or getting bumped no longer means your race is over. You can jump right back into the action and keep going. <i>Turbo-Resets</i> can be unlimited, limited, or disabled, when the multiplayer host is set up.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A single player <i>Progression</i> feature is included for building up one's driving skill from slow to very fast race cars. Any car or car setup can be used in practice when not using <i>Progression</i>. For online play, the host's rules limit maximum settings for the race session. For example, if your car is set up with max engine torque of 700 and the host rules are limited to 500, your car will have 500 when racing in the host's session. A host/server password is provided to allow for private online racing sessions.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ACR</strong> supports Xbox and similar controllers, as well as the latest force-feedback wheels, pedals, and shifters. With the driving aids turned up, even keyboard is fun to play.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The current build includes 2 tracks (raced both ways for 4 effective tracks), 2 sports cars and 1 formula style race car. Low horsepower through high horsepower setups are included, and the vehicle editor can be used real-time while the car is on the track, even during a race.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ACR</strong> currently supports up to 24 online players with up to 88 cars in a race, even on modest hardware such as the OG Steam Deck. 30 days of online play included; $2.99/month thereafter to continue online play (single player always available). <strong>ACR</strong> will continuously be improved &amp; updated, while preserving the rapid racing experience as the community grows.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ACR</strong> is a simple, fast, and efficient simulator with a deep physics engine, providing an exciting and unique high-speed driving experience not available anywhere else.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953660/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735337656","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953660/page.bg.jpg?t=1735337656","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953660/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735337656","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2953660/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735337656","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Amazing Curves Racing</i> (<strong>ACR</strong>) is a single- and online multi-player racing simulator featuring advanced physics working directly on bicubic polynomial 3D curved surfaces.
