{"about_the_game":"Description:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImmerse yourself in a gripping and thrilling world in &quot;Hell God&quot;. In this epic action video game, you'll step into the shoes of a divine goddess armed with powerful weapons, ready to face hordes of supernatural enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConfront two types of foes: the main enemy, a relentless draugr wielding medieval weapons such as swords and axes, and the secondary enemy, floating skulls that approach and explode upon getting close to you. These enemies will relentlessly stalk you, attacking in swarms from all directions, testing your skills and reflexes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore a meticulously crafted winter setting of snow-covered mountains and frozen rivers in &quot;Hell God&quot;, reminiscent of the acclaimed game Skyrim. Journey through distinct areas, from the cozy Nordic House to the Backyard and Main Entrance, the bustling Marketplace adjacent to the house, an elevated mountain area nearby, a dock, and a cemetery across the river, accessed via a bridge. Unlock these zones by earning points through enemy eliminations, revealing upgrades and purchasing options for your weapons, akin to the style of Call of Duty Zombies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is structured in rounds, each one more challenging than the last. As you progress, you'll face increasingly numerous and formidable enemies. The key to advancing lies in earning enough points to unlock new areas on the map, where you'll discover upgrades and have the opportunity to acquire blessings for your weapons. Here's where the fun truly begins! Enhance your divine weapons and unleash their power, resulting in visually stunning and gratifying effects. From strategically placed icy mines to lightning bolts raining from the sky wherever you aim, and even a black hole that sucks in and explosively dispatches all enemies in the round into the heavens. The more spectacular your destruction, the higher your score.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of this is accompanied by an epic metal soundtrack that will immerse you in the experience of being a goddess in a Nordic land teeming with the undead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare to become the Hell God and face unparalleled challenges in this thrilling action game. Unleash your divinity and obliterate hordes of enemies in a frozen world crying out for salvation!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable now on Steam.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717435018","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492830/page.bg.jpg?t=1717435018","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717435018","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2492830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717435018","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Some scenes contain violence and blood.
