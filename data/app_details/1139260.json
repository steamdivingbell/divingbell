An Overgrown and Ruined set so you can show the passage of time - or the past. An Ensorcelled Set so you can get your players face to face with magical challenges, rogue mages and sorcerous threats and events - and a trail of cryptic murder scenes with grisly surroundings to add intrigue.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>6 x Overgrown City Variation Maps<br></li><li>6 x Ashen City Variation Maps<br></li><li>6 x Raging Inferno Variation Maps<br></li><li>5 x Ensorcelled/Magic-Afflicted Variation Maps<br></li><li>3 x Ruined Variation Maps<br></li><li>4 x Murder Scene Variation Maps</li></ul><br>Maps are sized specially for FG at 1350x900 and under 500 kb each to help prevent slow-down during play.
