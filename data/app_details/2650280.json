{"about_the_game":"Sentenced to death for your ability to wield multiple arcane Shards at once, you must fight for survival and become the danger that the Empire claims you to be. Arcana Outcasts takes the top-down shooter roguelike formula and throws in several magical twists.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Shard-Shifting Action</strong>: Each of your elemental Shards has a limited reserve of mana. To survive, you must think on the fly, switching off of depleted mana pools to engage the enemy with fresh magic, and planning out how to use your resources to succeed in each encounter.<br></li><li><strong>Plan your Path</strong>: Take advantage of a unique form of progression in the form of pseudo-randomized skill trees. Discover hundreds of available skills, weigh up the costs of reaching distant nodes, and use forbidden secrets to manipulate the tree and find your own path to victory.<br></li><li><strong>Devastating Synergy</strong>: While a Shard can be powerful on its own, they are even stronger in concert. Bolster your minions with healing, freeze enemies solid before picking them off with thunderstrikes, wipe out a horde with a cascading chain reaction, or use walls of stone to trap enemies inside an inferno: these are just a few of the options available to discover.<br></li><li><strong>Dangerous Encounters</strong>: The Empire's forces aren't content to simply march ahead to their doom. Many enemies have access to the arcane Shards as well, posing unique and dynamic threats that must be accounted for. Further, gaining the power necessary to survive requires taking risks: to gain the power of a Shard, you must first weather its storm.</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736474205","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736474205","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650280/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736474205","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2650280/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736474205","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3026840,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Sentenced to death for your ability to wield multiple arcane Shards at once, you must fight for survival and become the danger that the Empire claims you to be.
