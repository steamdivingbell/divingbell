{"about_the_game":"<strong>A simple square</strong> is a puzzle game with <strong>many</strong> interacting mechanics, which you will discover throughout your adventure in a <strong>large</strong> amount of diversified levels.<br><br>Each game board has only one objective, to reach the finish. But don't think it's going to be that easy. Once you start going in a direction, you can't change it until you stop, and because good news never comes alone, you're blocking the path in your way, so it's often impossible to go back.<br><br>All of this with more or less complex mechanics that will intertwine to test you in a hundred or so increasingly complex levels. Some will allow you to stop on a square, others to teleport, to pass through walls, etc.. I leave you the surprise and the discovery of the levels and mechanics that will punctuate your adventure.<br><br>Good Luck, Have Fun, <i><u>if You Can</u></i>.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736463557","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251740/page.bg.jpg?t=1736463557","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251740/5bf1017edf1d2841e5fb53ca402625fd518778a6/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736463557","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2251740/5bf1017edf1d2841e5fb53ca402625fd518778a6/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736463557","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>A simple square</strong> is a puzzle game with <strong>many</strong> interacting mechanics, which you will discover throughout your adventure in a <strong>large</strong> amount of diversified levels.<br><br>Each game board has only one objective, to reach the finish.
