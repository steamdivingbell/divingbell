Be the town's favorite clothing vendor, using your gift of gab and negotiation skills (through a unique DBG card system) to win customers' hearts, or join the ranks of Housai Knights, zipping through the town's streets on a scooter, spreading warmth and convenience.

Forge deep friendships with townsfolk by giving gifts, participating in their daily lives, and potentially developing romantic relationships leading to marriage.
