{"about_the_game":"Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet in late 19th century Japan and England, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists, and \u201cturnabouts\u201d you\u2019ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the course of each case, you\u2019ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn\u2019t shout \u201cOBJECTION!\u201d when you know you\u2019ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution\u2019s claims and prove your client\u2019s innocence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOTE: This game can be played with English audio or with Japanese audio and English subtitles.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"The Great Ace Attorney","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/649f7d22102e3f08b4266f81dd853e9ed28c1e40.jpg"},{"name":"Defence Debut","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/d7f0cc43398faec895b2365beab0751ed684f335.jpg"},{"name":"Crash Course Candidate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/84d5639f0f7624aad0e9186d8d3491f71c058278.jpg"},{"name":"The Realm of the Reaper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/88e9d77ee6f840773a6dfa28cda90459a835e0c0.jpg"},{"name":"Landed in London","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/b25f7f602a496b6916b7423b1eefebafd4823fea.jpg"},{"name":"Fleeting Farewell","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/bb5eb854032895c99344e34a99aaff73893ac906.jpg"},{"name":"Susato's Success","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/3b08a49139c03b0ad968f722cbce84e67b5fb295.jpg"},{"name":"The Key of Knowledge","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/253b98ed47272bf0cfd8237e66f49a913d399c38.jpg"},{"name":"The Demasking","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/7ff4f379026ad48c9024c682bfec1fce69a73309.jpg"},{"name":"The Legendary Pair","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1158850/88a68f734f1c91fa4695a859b559f661e343a0cc.jpg"}],"total":30},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727757784","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158850/page.bg.jpg?t=1727757784","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727757784","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1158850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727757784","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSet in late 19th century Japan and England, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists, and \u201cturnabouts\u201d you\u2019ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney.
