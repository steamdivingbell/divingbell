{"about_the_game":"Puppet Master is a PC strategy/simulation game that puts you in control of a shadow organization dead set on global domination via bribery, intimidation, seduction, and any means necessary.

When you enter a new nation, you\u2019ll be alone with just a headquarters at your disposal and minimal information.
