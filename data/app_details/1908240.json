Goya's story is one of particular resonance. He saw horrors in his lifetime, and the especially bleak period which saw the creation of Goya's Black Paintings is a superb basis for a supernatural horror game. There are things in those paintings nobody would like to see come to life.\u201d<br>-PC Gamer<br><br>\u201cThe voice acting is excellent, the stealth mechanics work well (and are fairly forgiving) and the painterly art style is absolutely stunning. You really do feel like you\u2019ve been transported into one of Goya\u2019s tortured masterpieces and although it\u2019s a dark and twisted place, it\u2019s beauty makes you never want to leave.
