{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The F-5E was developed in the United States the early '70s as an upgraded version of the F-5A. This exceptional light multi-role fighter was initially designed as a privately funded project. Combat roles of the F-5E include both air-to-air and unguided ground attack. In the United States, it has also excelled as an aggressor fighter adversary aircraft. Given its mission flexibility, ease of operation, and low cost, the F-5E continues to serve air forces including Iran, Switzerland, and others.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The F-5\u0415 is armed with two 20 mm \u041c39-\u04103 cannons, each with 280 rounds. The cannons are in the nose section and include deflectors that direct hot gas away from the engine inlets. Each cannon has a firing rate of 1,500 to 1,700 rounds per minute.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wingtips incorporate a launcher rail capable of firing AIM-9 infrared-guided missiles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Five hard points (one centerline pylon and four underwing pylons) allow carriage of bombs, cluster munitions, and rockets. To extend the range, external fuel tanks can be attached to three wet points (a centerline pylon and two inboard pylons).
