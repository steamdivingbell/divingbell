{"about_the_game":"Cast or Pass started as a game jam project that I thought was a ton of fun and tried to make into a full game.  Pick a character with a pre-built deck of spells that you can use to battle against your friends.  Game is in real time with each card being balanced between power and cast time.  Decks are only shuffled once at the start so you can try to gain an advantage by figuring out when your opponent has no defensive spells and throwing out your strongest magic to punish those openings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI've found that this game has a bit of a learning curve where players will start out by just throwing out spells and trying to overwhelm their opponent.  People are kind of slow to change of that strategy because you get a little worse if you think about your cards too long, but it's an important step to take to become a master and be able to throw out spells both quickly and strategically, so don't get discouraged.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI've got a bunch more characters with new spells on the way but I get bottle-necked by the art and sound for them, so they won't be out for a bit, but just know that they will come.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719868694","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777980/page.bg.jpg?t=1719868694","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719868694","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2777980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719868694","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Wizards talk trash and throw fireballs in a fight to the death.
