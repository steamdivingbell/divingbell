These are nasty, sneaky, big-mouthed aquatic devils that would swallow you up in no time \u2026 plus the real-slick, fast-turning sharks and other enemies as well that just love keeping you in their stomachs.

SHARK!\u00ae </strong>you control a fish! Your goal is to earn as many points as possible while staying alive. Swimming in the ocean with you are other fish of various sizes, lobsters, crabs, jellyfish, kraken, puffer fish, orca, electric eel, and a very fast shark. You are able to eat any fish that is smaller in size than you are, and any fish that is larger will eat you! The shark can also be defeated if you nibble at its tail several times, but be careful for the shark can turn quickly. And be also aware of the lobster, crab, kraken, puffer fish, orca, and the electric eel. Each time you eat a fish or nibble on the shark\u00b4s tail, points are earned. When some shells on the bottom open, you have to be quick and collect the pearls inside. Each time you score, your fish will grow larger in size allowing you to eat even more of the fish on the screen. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2410640/extras/in_text_deco.png?t=1731351826\" /><br>The original version (included in this version) of <strong>SHARK!
