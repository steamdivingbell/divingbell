{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Check in to your hotel, and check out the ghosts! Sexy specters await you - but can you fix up the hotel in style so that the living guests will find luxury, too?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Haunted Hearts Hotel</i> is an interactive erotic paranormal romance novel by Elle Grace. It\u2019s\u00a0 entirely text-based, 158,000 words and hundreds of choices, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You\u2019ve spent your whole life visiting the majestic Hotel Lexington, and now you\u2019ve inherited it! The once-grand building is in disrepair, and rumored to be haunted! You\u2019re the only one who can restore its former glory before it\u2019s lost forever. The Lexington and its surrounding town stand at a crossroads: will they pursue modern luxury; or look to the past to recapture its faded splendor?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">It\u2019s time for you to roll up your sleeves and get to work renovating the hotel into the destination of everyone's dreams! You get to choose how you\u2019ll shape the Lexington\u2019s future: will you create a luxury spa in the nearby hot springs; restore the speakeasy bar to its 1920s glamour; turn the kitchen into a foodie\u2019s dream; or pour all your resources into making the guest rooms perfect for a romantic weekend getaway? Or, embrace the ghost stories and local history of spiritualism, bringing in a hit ghost-hunting TV show to make the Lexington a hotspot for paranormal tourism!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Or maybe you\u2019ll have a few nights of passion in those rooms yourself. You need to court some investors, and wealthy Remington Peabody is certainly worth courting. With icy blue eyes and platinum-silver hair, this scion of a prominent local family loves to take charge in bed just as much as in the boardroom, teasing you with sensual massage, radiating magnetic charisma, and holding you tight with strong hands.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Or, there\u2019s Sunny Thompson, star of the hit TV show Ghost Brigade: bright and enthusiastic and cheerful to match the name, with rosy kissable lips and an ever-changing hairstyle. Sunny\u2019s a true believer in the paranormal, with a taste for grand romantic gestures like horse-drawn carriage rides - but if you want to play rough in the bedroom, Sunny is only too happy to turn that playfulness into nips and slaps.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Then there\u2019s Manfri Booney, the hotel\u2019s faithful concierge. They have courtly manners and a flamboyant style all their own: tousled black curls, crushed velvet jackets, cedar-scented cologne, sweet dimples, and an impish smile. They might spend their days fulfilling guests\u2019 wishes - and as a medium, they keep the ghostly guests happy along with the living ones - but they\u2019re happy to take the lead in the bedroom with scorching kisses.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">And what about Della Rose? This hotel guest has loads of confidence and a devastatingly glamorous fashion sense: bobbed dark hair, jeweled headbands and fringed dresses, with ruby-red lipstick and sparkling emerald eyes. She loves dancing under the stars at a midnight picnic - and loves it even more when you go down on her. But doesn\u2019t she fit in far too well in the 1920s speakeasy bar?
