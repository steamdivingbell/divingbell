Prepare to have your timbers well and truly shivered as you enter the pell mell pirate world of Sally Forth, a plucky buccaneer on the high seas out to make a name for herself and rescue her hapless captain from the clutches of the sinister Captain Clamm. Assisted by the ship\u2019s duck, Richardson, (they\u2019re too broke to afford a parrot), and a cavalcade of cantankerous characters she meets along the way, Sally becomes embroiled in many a daring escapade as she strives to reinstate her motley crew and perhaps find some swaggering swag along the way.
