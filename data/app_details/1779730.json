{"about_the_game":"A nonsensical, action beat 'em up wherein characters must fight to stay on-screen, avoiding ring-outs. Each character represents a video game category, minus the twin game streamers. There's a move where a character who represents simulation games changes it depending on the time of day it is. There are specials such as using a part of a claw machine to help you catch yourself while you control the claw. Then there's the twin streamers, who can livestream one attack from wherever they left their laptop at.
