It's a compact, tightly-crafted whodunit that drips with history and intrigue. With cunning deceptions, cave-ins and cobras aplenty, the game's got the right balance of scary but not too scary.\u201d<br>\u2013 USA TODAY<br><br>\u201cHer Interactive has clearly done extensive research to create puzzles, events, and characters that are authentic and faithful to the world of archeology in Egypt while taking creative liberties where appropriate. Most of the puzzles require knowledge of Ancient Egyptian culture, all of which is imbibed in game. I applaud this studio for entertaining me and making me feel like an Egyptologist simultaneously.\u201d<br>\u2013 GameZebo","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_91b1f255923c2f5ac356e94b813fa3cca6558f8f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_91b1f255923c2f5ac356e94b813fa3cca6558f8f.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_8f8a9f82efc89286d053e30808ebb9a392322716.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_8f8a9f82efc89286d053e30808ebb9a392322716.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_ce4ca376491444acb0185f56e3c78a325cb54ae6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_ce4ca376491444acb0185f56e3c78a325cb54ae6.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_a53fe0eeb96cf0573f078ed28879781033f03074.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_a53fe0eeb96cf0573f078ed28879781033f03074.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_f5fa59f8d69d33e986880aaac135607c9c3864be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_f5fa59f8d69d33e986880aaac135607c9c3864be.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_ee1ceb168db278e1242ca0d00b6799c8880fe290.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_ee1ceb168db278e1242ca0d00b6799c8880fe290.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_71f771b9d5bc83fcb3ebae7d4cf7d482c27a5b44.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_71f771b9d5bc83fcb3ebae7d4cf7d482c27a5b44.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_12b175d12c3f1ead3a2599474b5a9da5ccd5dfae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_12b175d12c3f1ead3a2599474b5a9da5ccd5dfae.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_3a4fbc2f5c587e4b102778a8bd5d0ab2dab31b19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_3a4fbc2f5c587e4b102778a8bd5d0ab2dab31b19.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_72b74dbb2d1b76237079de9ce9599d4a8fa06c7a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734469111","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210230/ss_72b74dbb2d1b76237079de9ce9599d4a8fa06c7a.600x338.jpg?t=1734469111"}],"short_description":"Unearth Sinister Secrets in an Ancient Egyptian Tomb!","steam_appid":210230,"support_info":{"email":"techsupport@herinteractive.com","url":"https://www.herinteractive.com/support/contact-support/"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":"https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-tomb-of-the-lost-queen/"}
