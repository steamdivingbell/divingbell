{"about_the_game":"Jump into the role of a star and experience a new type of social gameplay!<br><br>Velvet Sundown is a social multiplayer role-playing game, taking place on a luxury yacht cruising the waters of a fictitious Caribbean state of Balbonia. Embark on a journey full of conspiracies, trickery and secrets where you can never tell a friend from foe.<br><br>In the beginning of each game you are assigned one of the 11 readymade characters at random. Each character has their own unique agenda to pursue, as well as a randomized goal to strive for. Fulfilling your objectives might not be as easy as it seems though: as everyone else has their own secrets, some of the people aboard might not be as willing to co-operate as you would like. It is up to you to use your cunning, wits and social skills to get what you want and avoid spilling your own secrets.<br><br>The scenarios are always multiplayer and require a minimum of 4 players, which means that every character you see is played by a real person. This also means completing quests always requires freeform chatting and interaction with the other characters. <br><br>Velvet Sundown is based on the Dramagame engine developed by the Finnish game developer Tribe Studios Ltd.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The first entertainment title ever to use revolutionary Dramagame mechanics and technology<br></li><li>Endless replayability: players' actions affect how each scenario plays out, so every session is truly unique<br></li><li>Uses high-quality text-to-speech technology by Acapela to enhance immersion<br></li><li>No grinding, no killing, no looting \u2013 just 100% pure role-playing</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/307290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447362267","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/307290/page.bg.jpg?t=1447362267","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/307290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447362267","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/307290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447362267","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Jump into the role of a star and experience a new type of social gameplay!<br><br>Velvet Sundown is a social multiplayer role-playing game, taking place on a luxury yacht cruising the waters of a fictitious Caribbean state of Balbonia.
