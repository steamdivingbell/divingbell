A threatening creature emerges from the darkness, and your only chance is to hide or outsmart it to survive the night. To make it through, you must endure until dawn, using your wits, limited resources, and the environment to stay one step ahead of the lurking horror. Every action you take matters, and the slightest mistake could cost you your life.
