I will let you in on a lil secret.... the dev himself is stuck on lvl 58...... shhhhh! ;) The progression is not an excessive jump in difficulty, but this is definitely only for adults and puzzle lovers. I cannot wait for even bigger and more challenging levels and I am sure anyone who loves this type of puzzle will be just as eager as I am for them to arrive!  FINAL THOUGHTS: A well-presented and polished game that is a joy to play and behold. The dev has been thoughtful, communicates with players and is quick to respond to any issues that arise.... unlike other devs who have and do dump their games on this platform and then give us crickets! I highly recommend to all puzzle lovers to give this game a fair go. Replay ability is high, just like your favourite card or board game. It is cheap and worth every cent even at full price.... the dev should really consider raising the price in my opinion! This game could easily be sold for at least $3 - $5 and when it reaches 200 levels could well be worth paying $7.50.
