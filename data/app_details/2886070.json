{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Two down-on-their-luck detectives, Joe and Dan, are overdue on their rent. After months of dodging payments, they're facing eviction from their seedy apartment if they don't make some cash. Then one day, a sorcerer appears to the pair and tells them that they're the legendary heroes as foretold in an ancient prophecy! Great riches await, but only if they travel back to medieval times and defeat some sort of ancient evil that's risen up. Yeah, why not, right? It's either that or going back to live with their parents. (They said a detective agency was a bad idea. Yeah, right!) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Armed with nothing more than their guns, wits, and a dismembered ancient hand, Joe and Dan travel back to the past to secure their future, all while solving cases along the way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Gameplay features turn-based battle progression with a variety of monsters to fight.
