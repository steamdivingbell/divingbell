{"about_the_game":"Wishlist is a 2D side-scrolling pixel art game that tells the story of a protagonist who is disappointed with life in the real world. By coincidence, they travel back to their childhood and relive their past life, making up for past regrets. You will once again dominate your childhood as the protagonist, experiencing the joys and tears of the 90s, revisiting things you miss, or fulfilling unfinished wishes. You can fight all night in the arcade without worrying about your parents' constraints; go through the college entrance exam again and choose your own path in life; experience a missing childhood, this time with your parents by your side; even travel back to the pages of textbooks, talk and laugh with ancient people, and compete with mathematicians. Embark on a grand magical journey.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1719214539","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1719214539","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1719214539","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1719214539","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Wishlist is a 2D side-scrolling pixel art game that tells the story of a protagonist who is disappointed with life in the real world.
