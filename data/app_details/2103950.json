You can opt for different classes that drastically change the gameplay. Currently, the game features 3 classes: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Defender</strong>: In this form, your Kritter fights in melee combat with a sword. It can leap into the air and crash down on groups of enemies. The Defender can also build a scarecrow to distract and lure monsters wherever desired. The Defender is sturdy and can construct solid stone walls. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Engineer</strong>: Your Kritter fights here at mid-range with a flamethrower. A true war machine, the Engineer also shoots sharp nuts around him. It can place turrets that automatically target your opponents. The Engineer is more fragile than its counterparts but more destructive. </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Tracker</strong>: Your Kritter wields a sniper rifle here; the Tracker can take down targets from kilometers away. It also has a mortar shot for area damage and can place mines along its path to greet those foolish enough to follow. The Tracker creates barriers that its shots can pass through. Handy!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AN OVERWHELMING THREAT</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103950/extras/Defeat_and_coming_back_stronger.gif?t=1738957077\" />Despite your efforts, it's highly likely that defeat will occur at some point. M.Ark will then rewind time, bringing you back to its cockpit, and everything will need to be done again... Well, almost everything! You'll be able to upgrade your Kritter or M.Ark between games using soul crystals! These major upgrades will make life easier for you: adding a shield around M.Ark, adding a radar to know where enemies are coming from, enhancing your strength, boosting your resources, increasing your life... The choices are numerous!<br> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A STORY THAT UNFOLDS OVER TIME</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Kritter is a story of time. When you lose, you rewind time; when you play, you battle against time... The story itself unfolds within this temporal chaos. M.Ark is the narrator of the story... But M.Ark suffers from amnesia! With each defeat, with each return to its cockpit, the story will progress. It is through advancing that M.Ark will gradually remember the reason for our presence here.<br> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DYING IS MORE FUN TOGETHER</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2103950/extras/Multij-steam.gif?t=1738957077\" />Kritter is a demanding game that will require you to face death more than once...
