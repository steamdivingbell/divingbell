Set during the period of Operation OVERLORD (beginning 06 June 1944), Europe In Ruins offers persistent cross-battle XP, hundreds of doctrine selections, and an ongoing PvP warmap campaign. Decide which of 12 battlefield doctrines to follow, then customize your company by selecting from a range of units and upgrades available. Build your company one unit at a time by purchasing them with Manpower, Munitions, and Fuel resources, and then take your company into battle against other players across a wide variety of maps and game modes. Battles are fought over the ongoing warmap campaign, as both Axis and Allied forces fight for control of Europe! </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Europe In Ruins receives regular updates.
