{"about_the_game":"Celebrate the end of 2020--the Year of Poop--with this bizarre throwback to second-generation video games of the early 1980s!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoggers are happily trotting across the local park in an effort to reach their fitness goals.  But--armed with the healthiest metabolism the world has ever seen--you're going to put a stop to that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake your way across the park and poop everywhere. Little poops will only slow the joggers down, but keep pooping to increase poop size. When a jogger hits a large poop, they'll be stopped for good and you'll score a point! If you run out of fuel, simply go back to the starting point alongside the taco restaurant and eat. Then you'll be ready for more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this love letter to old console games from the early 80s, you'll enjoy unique, one-button, fast-paced action that only gets faster! The action is paired with classic-style visuals and authentic sound effects created with Korg synthesizer software.  With two difficulty levels, and Time Attack mode, you'll chase high scores across 4 Steam Leaderboards.  Available DLC adds three unique new rulesets and 12 more Leaderboards!  There's a set of Achievements too!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe joggers will come faster and in greater numbers, but you'll be ready. This time is going to be different. Look out, joggers...you're going to have a crappy day.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dumping Ground","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/35cf140b7b134641ce4f3e778528efa2b9442c45.jpg"},{"name":"Marathon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/b6993547d321ba9160b56e72ba310c93548242d3.jpg"},{"name":"Oops","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/055bc9a1dea6427e60e487ab65aef6326bb19ef5.jpg"},{"name":"Got 'em!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/58cb8c2a964f1f01bc66cc586f50fd7d29c2eb36.jpg"},{"name":"100","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/350b3a7016501c298fadef315af4efdbf91b14af.jpg"},{"name":"250","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/04d87524e1049bef7cd01a8ea9f4015d124e856d.jpg"},{"name":"500","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/82c6e258d59f1168a599d95d278efbfca1c0d737.jpg"},{"name":"Hardcore","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/cb53fb7088d6a55193e911e3926c0ef0215df252.jpg"},{"name":"7 Minutes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/3b13f4ca203074875938c77711e41de38358833f.jpg"},{"name":"5 Minutes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1492450/4121f9cdf3f36a712493a6b9e47acc3e21faba59.jpg"}],"total":17},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1492450?t=1728959787","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492450/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1728959787","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728959787","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1492450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728959787","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Celebrate the end of 2020--the Year of Poop--with this bizarre throwback to second-generation video games of the early 1980s!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoggers are happily trotting across the local park in an effort to reach their fitness goals.
