Taking cues from the recent revival of the genre, the focus is on story with puzzle solving being the glue that ties it together. Mick's a pretty practical guy, and so puzzles are down-to-earth, designed to be unobtrusive, and give an investigative feel.  We're keeping the pacing quick and lean, you'll never be wandering around lost or confused - Mick is propelled through the story at a good clip, from one situation to another, with barely a moment to catch his breath.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEMO CREDITS</h2>Since there are no credits in this demo build, here they are instead<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dave Lloyd - Story, Code, Sound<br></li><li>Barney Cumming -  Art<br></li><li>Matt Frith - Background Art<br></li><li>Alex McDonald - Character Animation<br></li><li>Louis Meyer - Music<br></li><li>Mitchell Pasmans - Music<br></li><li>Julia Harari - Voice Acting (Ladies)<br></li><li>Adrian Vaughan - Voice Acting (Gentlemen)</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727858093","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207670/page.bg.jpg?t=1727858093","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727858093","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727858093","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The Drifter contains horror themes, pixelated violence and blood, frequent strong language, and mature themes such as homelessness and references to drug and alcohol abuse."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207670/extras/DrifterBanner-Features-150.gif?t=1727858093\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> A <strong>Pulp Adventure Thriller</strong> from the minds that brought you Crawl and Peridium.<br></li><li> An engrossing <strong>roller-coaster of a story</strong> -  Drawing on King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Ozploitation.<br></li><li> <strong>Point 'N Click or Controller</strong> - Featuring unique twin-stick interaction makes The Drifter as comfy to play on the couch as at the PC.<br></li><li> Brooding dark-synth <strong>cinematic score.</strong><br></li><li> <strong>Fully voice acted.</strong></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEMO</h2>This demo contains the first chapter of the full game, compete with it's own twists and turns!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1207670/extras/DrifterBanner-Synopsis-150.gif?t=1727858093\" /><br><br>Mick Carter's been drifting a while now - never staying one place long, moving from job to job.
