Using the power of falling blocks, weave together powerful combo attacks, use elemental powers, throw items, sabotage enemy attacks, and grow in power to thwart everything from lowly Beewis and Cookie Ferrets to Craggans and Battle-Axolotls.<br><br>Flowstone Saga has real-time or optional <strong>turn-based</strong> combat where you face off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters act automatically, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.<br><br>By clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. But this is just the beginning!<br><br>You'll need to carefully match the <strong>Link Crystals</strong> that appear to build up <strong>Heat</strong> and increase damage, clear helpful <strong>Orbs</strong> to heal yourself or trigger special attacks, use the <strong>Flask</strong> to throw powerful item effects on to the board, and defend yourself from <strong>deadly monsters</strong>. For every ability <i>you</i> have, monsters bring their own to the table: they'll ruin your board (and your HP) with attacks like fire breath, paralysis, sandstorms, lasers that destroy tiles, and much more.<br><br>You'll also unlock <strong>Powers</strong> that allow you to infuse the board with elemental magic like Fire, Ice, and Lightning, hurl pieces directly at enemies, create giant pieces, repair your board, and enhance combos. Combined with lots of build-enhancing <strong>equipment</strong>, a customizable <strong>Flask</strong>, passive <strong>Perk</strong> tree and even a <strong>Job (Frog) System</strong>, tons of unique strategies are possible.

You can switch to <strong>Hold Mode</strong> at any time, which changes the flow of battle into a <strong>turn-based style</strong>!<br><br>In <strong>Hold Mode</strong>, blocks do not fall at all: you get to move them at your leisure. Enemies will not attack in real-time either. Instead, every time you lock a piece into place, enemy action bars will tick up slightly. You'll see exactly how many pieces are left before they get a turn, so you can plan out your tactics in peace.<br><br>We've taken care to make sure <strong>Flowstone Saga</strong> is just as balanced &amp; fun in <strong>Hold Mode</strong> as it is in real-time, so that even puzzle novices can enjoy the richness of the game's RPG systems!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Grand Story</h2><br>In the sleepy backwaters of <strong>Ocean's End</strong>, a young adventurer and her stalwart pet Sprig stumble on an <strong>ancient power</strong> hidden beneath long-forgotten ruins.
