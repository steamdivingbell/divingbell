{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you effectively control a 8-wheeler with a T-Rex on top? Or a 16-wheeler with a Triceratops?

There are currently two racing tracks:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Japan Tournament: with racing track winding through scenic prehistoric forest, and a ramp/pyramid leading to a volcano at the end of the track. Climb the pyramid to reach the mouth of the volcano where the finish line is.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">USA Tournament: where racing track is massive highways across the desert. If you ever get thrown off the highways and get distracted, you can explore the saguaros and country houses underneath. Stay on the road, however, and drive through an ending section of very steep ramp to also reach the mouth of the volcano to end the game.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by the fond memories of playing Road Rash, this game allows players to slam into others (fighting is a development stretch goal) during the race.
