{"about_the_game":"<strong>The Backrooms Deeper is a game that touches on the entire spectrum of emotions. Fear, joy, happiness, calm, dread, frustration, elation and sadness. The game is extremely difficult at times. You will die a lot. While at the same time it is partially a calm walking simulator. </strong><br><br>&quot;It's been three years since Caleb no-clipped into the Backrooms. Three torturous, horrific and mournful years. He would be 8 years old by now. His mother left me a year ago because of my obsession with finding a way into the Backrooms. I couldn't no-clip in the park where Caleb did when we were playing that day. It seems the entrances move. Pop in and out of existence. Evaporate here and then condensate there. I've found a way now though. I believe I've found a way now. This letter is my last communication with this world before I enter, and I'm not coming out until I find Caleb. I'm exhilirated and beyond excited for my journey; I am afraid but that won't stop me. Nothing could be worse than what I've gone through. I'm going in with a video camera and that is all. And I will be coming out with Caleb... no matter how long it takes.&quot;<br><br>Time is irrelevant. Death is just a restart. Experience is a lesson.<br><br>In The Backrooms: Deeper you have one chance to find your son Caleb. Not to fear though, as due to the supernatural properties of The Backrooms you are ressurrected every time after death. Keep a keen eye out for subtleties in the rooms, the walls, and the landscape. There are things to learn. Hints and easter eggs everywhere. Each detail will help you inch closer to finding Caleb. There are no health potions (almond water) no weapons, no inventory at all except your camera, your infinite stamina and your wits. Your character doesn't level up, but more to the point - you do. Even through the repetition of navigating the twelve levels of The Backrooms you will learn. The walls speak. And maybe if you listen close enough, you can even hear Caleb, helping you along the way so that you can both escape the backrooms and end this everlasting loop. Then again, maybe it's all just your sanity dripping away.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1980010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684172629","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1980010/page.bg.jpg?t=1684172629","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1980010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684172629","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1980010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684172629","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Psychological horror.
