Instead, the aft compartment starts leaking air, perhaps the oxygen generator was stored there? It is up to you and your crew to decide what needs fixing first. Can your crew afford to take someone off of the guns to seal up the holes? Or perhaps you have plenty of oxygen stored up and sealing off the compartment is smarter for now.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i>Wish list and Join our Discord for Frequent Updates!</i></strong></p></li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3347170?t=1738799587","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3347170/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1738799587","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3347170/bdb677116733a1fe9f8069574b88b1f0224a4d8b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738799587","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3347170/bdb677116733a1fe9f8069574b88b1f0224a4d8b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738799587","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>A Co-op Space Adventure!</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Grab a few crew mates and man your battle stations as you fight through enemy infested space.
