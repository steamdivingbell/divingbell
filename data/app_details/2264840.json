You are left with nothing but your thoughts, trusty phone torch, and complete darkness... or so it seems. If the eerie darkness doesn't get you, something or someone sure will! Run for your life, through various station tunnels and modes of transport, solving puzzles and finding secrets to make your way home safely without being bitten, bruised, or well, to put it lightly... dead. You will be challenged. <br><br>The controls are simple enough to anyone who has played a FPS game before, use W, S, A, and D keys for movement and mouse for looking and interacting with in-game and user interface elements, a full list of controls can be found in the settings menu after launching the game.<br><br>Happy commuting! ;)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264840/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1701899022","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264840/page.bg.jpg?t=1701899022","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264840/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1701899022","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2264840/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1701899022","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The game includes blood, gore, and levels which display death and threat."},"detailed_description":"In <strong>(para)Normal Commute</strong>, you get thrown into the first person of your average office worker, simply trying to make your way home using any means necessary.
