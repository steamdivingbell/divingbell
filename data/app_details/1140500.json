The hotel entered its golden years at the start of the 1930's and remained a staple of luxury accommodation until the late 1940's, when a series of accidents involving the Barker family, which ended with the death of its two children, plagued its reputation and caused the hotel to enter a steady decline and be shutdown and abandoned in 1954.
