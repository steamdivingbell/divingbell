{"about_the_game":"risk of rabbit is an endless, randomly generated, fast paced, skill based, 2D side scroller, action game.<br />\r\nmy initial inspiration for this game was 'Risk of Rain', hence the similar game name. <br />\r\nbut as i worked on this, the game became less like Risk of Rain and more its own thing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\ni'm not sure what genre this game fits into. <br />\r\nthere is no platforming, you can't even jump at all in this game. <br />\r\nthere is no story, adventuring, or rpg elements. <br />\r\nthere are no puzzles. <br />\r\nthere are no bosses. <br />\r\nit's definitely *not* a roguelike, a beat em up, or a shoot em up. <br />\r\ni've seen my fair share of games and i don't know one that's really like this. <br />\r\nwhat i can say for sure though is that this is an exclusively action focused game. <br />\r\nthere is nothing, but action. :) <br />\r\nthe trailers portray this game very transparently. <br />\r\nwhat you see in those are full levels, they are whole gameplay loops. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nyou complete randomly generated levels about 1-2 minutes in length. <br />\r\nin each level, waves of swarming alien monsters spawn to the left and right. <br />\r\nyou play as a rabbit ninja and defeat them with your guns, sword, dash, kunais, bombs, and caltrops. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nthe gameplay is hopefully easy to learn but hard to master. <br />\r\nthe gameplay is fast, every action is quick, there are no long animations whatsoever. <br />\r\nthe gameplay can get pretty spammy, but blindly spamming your abilities is not effective. <br />\r\ntiming your abilities and using them strategically is key to completing high levels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthe game is endless, there will always be one more level. <br />\r\nthe difficulty of the game ever increases with each completed level. <br />\r\nthe goal of the game is to complete as many levels as you possibly can. <br />\r\n<br />\r\neach level is randomly generated with its own seed. <br />\r\nthis means all levels regenerate exactly the same way when replayed. <br />\r\nthe seeds for each level are the exact same for everyone too. <br />\r\nthis means we all play the exact same levels. <br />\r\ni did this so that we can all compete with each other and see who can complete the most levels. <br />\r\ncan you beat more levels than your friends? <br />\r\nmy highest completed level is 121, can you beat this? :) <br />\r\nif you'd like, post a video of the highest level you complete on Bluesky and include @riskofrabbit.bsky.social <br />\r\ni'll post my level 121 video after everyones had a chance to play. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthe gameplay and controls are unique, unlike anything you've probably played before. <br />\r\nyou control the ninja with a keyboard only, no other devices are supported. <br />\r\nthere are 14 keys to press, you use both of your hands on the keyboard. <br />\r\nyou aim your attacks using the keyboard. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nfor example... <br />\r\nto throw a bomb left, you press 'Q' with your left hands ring finger. <br />\r\nto throw a bomb right, you press 'E' with your left hands index finger. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nto slice your sword left, you press 'U' with your right hands index finger. <br />\r\nto slice your sword right, you press 'O' with your right hands ring finger. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nthis is how you input almost all of your actions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\ni've designed this game so that it should be able to run on old hardware. <br />\r\nif you have a 10+ year old laptop without a graphics card and 2GB of RAM, this game should hopefully run on that. <br />\r\n<br />\r\ni've also designed this game to be locked to 60 fps. <br />\r\ni've done this so that players with great hardware won't get an advantage running this game at high framerates. <br />\r\nso whether your playing on a potato laptop or a modern 3K gaming pc, you can be sure it's an even playing field. <br />\r\n<br />\r\ni found that locking this game to 60 fps does not adversely affect the fast paced/quick reaction nature of it. <br />\r\ni'm a competitive gamer and i don't notice any lag in my inputs while playing. <br />\r\nsince this game is driven entirely with a keyboard, you don't need a super high framerate for it to feel responsive. <br />\r\nif this we're a first person shooter and we we're using mice though, then it would be an entirely different matter. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\ni've designed this game so that it should look good at 4K. <br />\r\nthe assets are all high resolution and you'll only see the the full detail at 1440p and 4K. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthis game does not have any music. :( <br />\r\nit's the biggest glaring weakness of this game. :( <br />\r\ni'm not skilled at making music (at least not yet) and so could not make any. <br />\r\nthere is however a diverse palette of sound effects. <br />\r\nthe game gets very noisy and sounds like an intense battle. <br />\r\ni'm hoping this is enough to provide a satisfactory audio experience. <br />\r\n<br
