{"about_the_game":"Beware of the Blob is a puzzle &amp; crafting game with light stealth elements where you control a slime-like creature known as B.O.B. If you like quirky, light-hearted gameplay, zany humor, and fantastical body horror, you won\u2019t be disappointed. <br><br>Cartoonish, detached arms that wriggle in wait to capture victims, brains that slide when someone steps on them, disembodied projectile lungs are just some of what you\u2019ll find in the world of Beware of the Blob. Help B.O.B. escape from Black Hawk Industries HQ by eating lab personnel, crafting tools the organs they drop, and using those tools to solve puzzles.<br><br>We are a small team of recent graduate students and driven individuals who are passionate about games and game development. While we can\u2019t promise that no (virtual) lab personnel were harmed in the making of Beware of the Blob, we can promise you a few hours of a fun-filled fantasy.<br><br>Feel free to contact us if you have feedback, questions, or problems.
