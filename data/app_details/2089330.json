Server players have the right to revive after death. There are a lot of materials in the three banks: howitzers, advanced rifles, sniper rifles, anti tank rockets and bulletproof vests. At the same time, there are a lot of enemies in the three banks. The enemies are very fierce.

Little boluofu looked at the sky and asked the grandpa, one summer afternoon, they were enjoying the cool at the gate of the factory. A UFO directly dropped a virus missile without saying a word, causing the factory and local people to be infected with Z virus. The sudden invasion made the United Nations vibrate greatly. In order to hide this matter, the high-level leaders came forward to confuse the people and put their hopes on the peace talks (there is a difference of Five Civilized points in science and technology, but they can't fight). Aliens soon learned all human languages. Requirements: 1 Contract all hospitals and prisons to aliens (Note: conduct human experiments) 2 Cede most of the water source 3 It is forbidden to use navigation, network, GPS and other communication equipment. The people are very dissatisfied that the network is not used alone. Coupled with colonial rule, mankind is ready to revolt. Although the equipment is simple and crude, the Chinese never flinch in the face of powerful enemies. The X-1 is the most powerful armor in the world. It can still be used for repair. Hey, Captain master, this is recruit Cooper, come and report. Well, recruits, today is very punctual. We are going to Chernobyl today. Our task is to get the virus samples from the Research Institute and wait for our helicopter. It was to ensure the completion of the mission. However, our warship was attacked on the way. Only I came to Chernobyl alive. Captain master asked me to wear X-1 armor and complete the character he wanted to accomplish in his life before he died. I nodded. There are many infected people and aliens in Chernobyl, plus insufficient supplies. Fortunately, the monster dropped all kinds of equipment, and I was lucky to survive. When the helicopter came to pick me up, I breathed deeply and finally evacuated. Latest intelligence: Dr. Kane, who studied virus samples, was robbed by aliens and locked up in a local hospital in Japan. For the future of mankind, it is time to save Dr. Kane. The hospital is not short of materials. For the wave after wave of alien attacks, I was beaten back by myself. I received a notice: there are important materials and armaments in the hospital. Take them with me, and I also successfully completed the mission on my way to Tokyo, The helicopter was hit by an alien electromagnetic pulse and was shot down at the gate of a school named James. I reported this to the organization. They found that the pulse at night was relatively small, and they could arrange evacuation. They ordered me to do everything possible to survive until night, so I had to stay in this abandoned school for a while. Time soon arrived. In the evening, I sealed all the windows and doors with sandbags, but I couldn't stop some fish from escaping. After cleaning, I came to the attic. I followed the helicopter of the double line army to Tokyo. The battle of Tokyo is the most important battle, which is related to the life and death of mankind.
