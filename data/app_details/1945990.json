You'll achieve this by preparing your minions well for battle. As a trainer, you should also advance your own skills. To do this, you'll use the gold you collect through victories in the arena. Idle missions in the tavern also bring you gold. You can use it to upgrade your trainer skills and those of your minions. Afterwards, you fight your way across the dungeon on a map and encounter different enemies. Use your captured resources wisely while training your minions and you'll soon be able to rule over the monsters of the underworld.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dragon Hoard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/2698274def5e0019751e4a42cf57f87638945689.jpg"},{"name":"Dragon Hoard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/17d2acdc6abadc20a65be3e5110fb8e20b009128.jpg"},{"name":"Dragon Hoard","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/bba6dcd1127d6a8884996d5cdf3ed35ffa058715.jpg"},{"name":"Battlemaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/8556a55cc86f5db221c95d2c805fc4bc5d8d940d.jpg"},{"name":"Battlemaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/21a17b6ef7e037f135cbb903752a6ec607cc2596.jpg"},{"name":"Battlemaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/814e9eeb320186624e865c938f8ecfd4c70be897.jpg"},{"name":"Coach","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/1b71ebb42d6ddb0ed90dc963977860d0bf823f43.jpg"},{"name":"Coach","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/69239c442947ae50c92d9992e9471d199da61f57.jpg"},{"name":"Coach","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/391dc1ce9de32aa3407f3a589c1dd278f2c7aaa1.jpg"},{"name":"Soldier of Fortune","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1945990/b3a66d5743a5c60181b11dac5ca8cb2d4b2d3141.jpg"}],"total":42},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1945990?t=1727882624","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1945990?t=1727882624","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727882624","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727882624","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Experience epic minion adventures as a trainer in the dungeon</strong><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1945990/extras/MREM_header.jpg?t=1727882624\" /><br><br>You have the power over many little minions - train them to become unbeatable fighting machines and take the scepter in your hands!
