Each day brings new events that lead players to uncover the secrets of their mysterious neighbor, who is suspected of being a serial killer. This psychological horror narrative with a twist weaves together co-operative exploration, puzzles, and stealth gameplay, with sound playing a pivotal role. Players must strategically use walkie-talkies for communication and proximity chat in order to go far in their investigation, and their survival depends on how well they navigate the soundscape. Any sound, from footsteps to thrown objects, can either distract or alert the neighbor, turning the game into a nerve-wracking cat-and-mouse chase. As the siblings piece together the puzzle, they unexpectedly become entangled in a dangerous game that leads to a disturbing revelation about the neighbor. <br><br>I Witness is a game where elements of horror, drama, and psychological thriller blend together.
