{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enter the Yokai Realm</h2>Shrineflow is a multiplayer (1 vs 1) hide-and-seek game between a powerful Kitsune and a stealthy Ninja in a Japanese-inspired Yokai arena. The Kitsune uses her magical abilities to interact with the arena and track down her opponent. The Ninja uses his stealth skills and trickery to stay undetected while searching the arena for golden coins that will grant him access to the Kitsune\u2019s treasure trove.<br><br>No round is like any other, as both characters have multiple abilities to choose from at the start of each game. Will you storm through your realm as the Kitsune, determined to catch the intruder? Or will you evade and outwit a stronger opponent like the Ninja?<br><br>Enter the arena and outplay your friends in Shrineflow!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Student Team</h2>A student team pitched, planned, and developed this project as a capstone (thesis) project at the BYU Center for Animation. This game was accomplished from start to finish in a single year, and we\u2019re incredibly proud of our work. However, please keep in mind this project was completed quickly by students, and you will probably encounter bugs and other hiccups because of this. Most of our amazing team members are moving on to jobs or other coursework, meaning any updates after release are very unlikely. We appreciate your understanding, look forward to your feedback, and hope you enjoy experiencing the world we\u2019ve created.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2888340?t=1718291407","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2888340?t=1718291407","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2888340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718291407","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2888340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718291407","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enter the Yokai Realm</h2>Shrineflow is a multiplayer (1 vs 1) hide-and-seek game between a powerful Kitsune and a stealthy Ninja in a Japanese-inspired Yokai arena.
