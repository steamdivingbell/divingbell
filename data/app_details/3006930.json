One day, after returning from university, I questioned the repetitive nature of my life. It was then that I stumbled upon a time attack (RTA) game video online. Watching players clear challenges in mere seconds ignited a spark within me, making me wonder, &quot;How exciting would it be if a game could deliver results in just 10 seconds?&quot;<br><br>To bring this idea to life, I decided to develop a game called &quot;10 Second Rule&quot;. The goal is for players to clear different challenges within 10 seconds. The game is designed to be simple yet provide players with intense and rapid satisfaction. Currently, the game is in its final development stage, and we are gearing up for the August 5 release. I'm excited to see how players will react to this game.<br><br><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br><strong>Q</strong>: How much content is there?<br><strong>A</strong>: There's about three times as much content as in &quot;Exit 8&quot;.<br><br><strong>Q</strong>: How replayable is the game?<br><strong>A</strong>: Even after completing it once, there are still twice as many unseen stages to explore.<br><br><strong>Q</strong>: What is the difficulty like?
