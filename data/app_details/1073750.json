{"about_the_game":"Spheres The Ancient Fuses is a third person 3D platformer, but it is also focused on combat and puzzle solving. Inspired by many classic games that we grew up playing, our goal is to make a game that we would love to play!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This demo:</h2>This is a demonstration of the game, containing the story prologue and one of the 25 stages that are gonna be in the final version. Please consider this is an alpha version so some bugs may occur :)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spheres: The Ancient Fuses</h2>Join the quest to save the universe while exploring different planets in order to retrieve the ancient fuses! Spheres: The Ancient Fuses is a game being made by a two developers team, and its purpose is to combine elements from many games we love. In this universe, you control two characters: a scientist who ran away from Earth and an alien robot who is just the cutest little thing you'll ever see. As you collect fuses to help the robot recover his memory, you enable the scientist to decipher a  little more of the droid's encrypted  software code, unraveling mysteries and unlocking new abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Transform And Relocate</h2>The main character you control, Spheres, have the ability to transform into any spherical object he finds in the level. The mechanic is simple: The robot draws the transfer gun from the top of his head, he then shoots at a spherical object and transforms into it, changing its position, color and size to match the new host.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Punch Enemies Out Of Your Way</h2>Along with the platform and puzzle mechanics, this game also focus on combat. Sphere's main weapons are his floating boxing gloves. Alternate between  light and heavy attacks to perform different combos!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be The Captain Of Your Own Spaceship</h2>As the scientist,  travel through space in your own spaceship, discovering new planets and facing some different challenges than you usually do when controlling Spheres.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Development</h2>The game started as a project for a brazilian school's internal gamejam. During the course of a week, dev teams had to make a game related  to the theme: &quot;One geometrical shape&quot;. The game &quot;Robot Ball&quot; (as it was presented at the competition) was solo developed by Thiago and got first place in the jam. After that, Thiago continued developing the game in his free time with very limited resources, using borrowed stuff from the school, an old laptop that could barely run the engine and would restart all the time due to overheating,  a cellphone to record sounds and all the voice acting was made by himself. Even with no investment, the game caught some eyes and Thiago was invited to present &quot;Spheres&quot; at a video game event in his city. Matheus, who had recently enrolled in the same gamedev school as Thiago, was asked to help him in the event presentation. The game got very positive feedback during the event, and Matheus was invited to collaborate to the project. The two started to dedicate full-time to the game without getting payment of any kind, and after three months, they presented the prototype to a small investor: Gabriel Nogueira. Amazed by what the team had produced so far, Gabriel Nogueira agreed to become their partners. The new team member bought a better computer, arranged a space at his own house to serve as an office and compromised to finance the basic needs of development, like internet, power, marketing and small equipment. Since then, the three partners are overcoming the challenges of developing a game out of love and persistence!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"NO UNDERWEAR DRIVING","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1073750/f3df41f741a50c95225dab2ee734d43b0d33a0e4.jpg"},{"name":"GO GO DJ!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1073750/91ee0eac4053e7754fc6cf59e0aa487423f2b78e.jpg"},{"name":"REMAINS OF A LOVE LETTER (?)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1073750/cdb22cc20db3caf9e984ca45e40731510538352b.jpg"},{"name":"MEDAL COLLECTOR","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1073750/b2bfc23d350bb960d02e114f14ff93066ad4de5c.jpg"},{"name":"UNTOUCHABLE","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1073750/b75558ef87ab697203cc1831351ef9ad493bd9e1.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1561123526","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073750/page.bg.jpg?t=1561123526","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1561123526","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1073750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1561123526","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Spheres The Ancient Fuses is a third person 3D platformer, but it is also focused on combat and puzzle solving.
