{"about_the_game":"<strong>TRAUMA</strong> tells a story of a young woman who survives a car accident. Recovering at the hospital, she has dreams that shed light on different aspects of her identity - such as the way she deals with the loss of her parents. TRAUMA lets you experience those dreams in an interactive way, reminiscent of Point-and-Click Adventure Games. It builds upon this established formula by introducing a gesture-based interface, real-time 3D technology for dynamic level layouts, unique photographic visuals and a level design philosophy that focuses on creating a rich experience rather than an elaborate puzzle challenge. Combined with the unconventional story, it is aimed to be a compact and deep game for a literate and mature audience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/98100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1572319314","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/98100/page.bg.jpg?t=1572319314","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/98100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1572319314","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/98100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1572319314","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>TRAUMA</strong> tells a story of a young woman who survives a car accident.
