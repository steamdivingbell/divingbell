{"about_the_game":"A dark/sad/weird/funny first person exploration game. You play a man on his last night alive as he obsesses over a mysterious painting. More of a story game in that it emphasizes mood and character over gameplay. Takes ten minutes to play and has &quot;next-gen&quot; features like a shrimp tank with pet shrimp. <strong>Be warned, the game contains explicit handling of suicide.</strong><br><br>For people that have played the game elsewhere, this is the original version, not an expansion or HD remake. <br><br>Follow me on twitter at @jessebarksdale. I post updates about new things there.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/387860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1587168503","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/387860/page.bg.jpg?t=1587168503","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/387860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1587168503","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/387860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1587168503","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A dark/sad/weird/funny first person exploration game.
