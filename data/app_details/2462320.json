{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">My Story</h2>I'm Mr. Moo! Over the last 5+ years, I've been obsessed with trying to make an amazing platformer, with tons of fun mechanics and super tight controls.

After lots of trial and error, Stolen Hearts: Wolf Knight is the combination of my best work, rolled up into a funny story about a birthday party gone wrong. <br><br>Stolen Hearts has been a great passion of mine for a while and it's inspired by so many of my favorite games, within and outside the genre.
