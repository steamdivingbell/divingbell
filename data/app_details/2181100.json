Mike, a lumberjack who has been living and working alone for more than a couple of decades, one freezing winter evening as usual returns home. It was supposed to be a usual routine evening. Supposed. The game challenges you to face your deepest fears as you navigate through a labyrinth of confusion, solitude, chaos, and distraction. As you move through the cursed hut, you must ignore the strange and unsettling surroundings and manage to survive the unknown horrors that are hiding in the dark.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181100/extras/ezgif.com-resize.gif?t=1726254167\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Main Gameplay Highlight</h2>In 'Nevermind this' you are thrust into a dark and foreboding world where every turn hides something new. The game features a mix of first-person exploration and adventure gameplay, as you must find solutions to many paranormal and blizzard situations.

The only thing that can remind us about civilization is the railway. As you explore the hut and the surrounding area, you will uncover clues and hints about the history of the lumberjack and the curse that has befallen the area.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Horror begins...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2181100/1a9043c074aeb16f51eff609437766414456553a.jpg"},{"name":"Hard winter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2181100/2b87225886b4251cc8c80ea2434b2e364cdf472b.jpg"},{"name":"Walls have secrets...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2181100/064cd6fefd2279deb85843d1c6099df6d304ff61.jpg"},{"name":"Time to sleep","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2181100/135c3e4d1cacdf09405438d582ebcf9dbdad6781.jpg"},{"name":"Horror finished...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2181100/a8ae0a0ac3887390e95cea3ccc069333badd2159.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726254167","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181100/page.bg.jpg?t=1726254167","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726254167","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726254167","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Our game includes such mature content as: dead bodies, blood, swearings, scenes of violent acts on simplified mannequins, weapons, scary sounds and screamers, and similar things that can cause fear, gore, suicidal and serial killer references."},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2181100/extras/DO_Not_NEVERMIND_wide.png?t=1726254167\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>Step into the infernal hut of 'Nevermind this', a drive-crazy horror game that takes place in deep woods.
