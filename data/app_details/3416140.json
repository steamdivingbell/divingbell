The player takes control of a virtuous character who, after being assassinated, falls into a hell he does not belong to. Hell consists of various layers, each presenting challenging boss battles while offering a balanced combat system featuring both magic and physical attacks. In the terrifying atmosphere of hell, the player must fight to survive, collect valuable loot to grow stronger, and unravel the depths of a mysterious story that reveals the reason behind the character\u2019s descent into hell.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Before Hell</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">His work in this world was done, whatever his mission was, he must have accomplished it.
