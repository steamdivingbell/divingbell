thoroughly enjoyed playing Epic Maze; I used to create mazes for my children when they were young. The ability to configure the game so many ways and the fact that no two levels with the same settings will ever be the same du to procedurally generated levels add to the re-playability. The only negative I have to say about this game is that there is little to differentiate between each room. I'd like to see different decorative schemes that would give the appearance of difference mansions; still the aim of the game is to solve mazes, so it's only a minor gripe.\u201d<br>recommended \u2013 Giveaway of the Day<br><br>\u201cA third-person replayable shooter with a new unique concept in which you must find your way in a procedurally generated 3d maze by following its music!
