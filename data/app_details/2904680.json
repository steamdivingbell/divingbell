{"about_the_game":"Earth~Quack is an adventure focused game with some survival elements where you play as a young boy on a mission to save a group of lost little ducklings and return them to their worried mother. As you journey through these lands you will encounter many things that will both help and hinder you in your quest to save the ducklings:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExploiting the Environment - As you travel you will need to harvest materials from the local environment in order to craft many tools that will aid you in your journey, ranging from hard hitting baseball bats, to long range sling-shots, to fancy flying boomerangs. Utilize Earth~Quack's inventory and crafting system to make tools both simple and complex. Furthermore, local flora can also be a bounty for many delicacies that may prove fruitful in tight situations. However, be careful, as it is not only you that might find these foods to be quite delicious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFending off Wild Beasts - With your newfound tools, you will be able to face harder and harder foes. It may be simple at first with squirrels and bees being quite easy to fend off; however, as you progress you will encounter more and more difficult beasts. This may range from dangerous encounters with venomous snakes in the scorching sands of the desert to fending off ferocious alligators in the moss filled waters of the swamp, both of which may need stronger equipment to fend off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSave the Ecosystem - Your journey ultimately culminates in a final encounter with the mighty Mountain Goat, who resides at the tallest peak of the nearby mountain range, constantly ramming into the mountainside causing vicious earthquakes, or &quot;Earth~Quacks&quot; as the locals refer to them, in the lands below. These constant disturbances spark fear and anger into the animals of the local ecosystems. Time and time again they are uprooted from their homes, taking out their frustration on the nearest thing to them. Your journey now becomes not only one of saving some little ducklings, but saving entire ecosystems.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Ducklings Lost","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/042468c3b5b9e9da032ec54d98e5d2a5f9115741.jpg"},{"name":"Simple Beginnings","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/be9c474569f8b5ff0de1dcc6c681fe8a6b831750.jpg"},{"name":"Breaker of Habitats","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/d5c36dbb7c28af901cc1dd81460bcd257d687d60.jpg"},{"name":"Zoologist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/44294387273b151ee6b5c6b1c06f147f5ea31dcb.jpg"},{"name":"Local Craftsman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/cd00103dcd2b66f1f2d10f2845eac500a883e4c1.jpg"},{"name":"Natural Delicacy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/1dd91d6e7d0a1e573ac72d36aa2edeb8a70d73b5.jpg"},{"name":"Shaking Things Up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/39e4121c609ff4601c6e697c9fda9bd5b32e7475.jpg"},{"name":"Just Like Home","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/ea6c7aa6cc04bf02021b03f8eb17b6d80a224e50.jpg"},{"name":"Snakes and Sand","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/70c785b4b382c0b93663464cf6f314566815ff82.jpg"},{"name":"Moss and Mud","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2904680/978a65799e59d4d4b05593c5b5d4c5917ea9924d.jpg"}],"total":32},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2904680?t=1727568679","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904680/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1727568679","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904680/f0de6dcc5f2bf170d71f89c6e8190298cd19bb37/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727568679","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2904680/f0de6dcc5f2bf170d71f89c6e8190298cd19bb37/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727568679","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Earth~Quack is an adventure focused game with some survival elements where you play as a young boy on a mission to save a group of lost little ducklings and return them to their worried mother.
