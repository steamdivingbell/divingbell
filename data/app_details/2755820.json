It's the future, so almost everything is no-code. Conducting experiments is a very gamified experience. The scientist is working on the first AI indistinguishable from humans. That AI is the main character of the story, and it needs layers of humanity. Those layers are the level segments. They are placed inside one another infinitely many times.

The scientist is breathing life into the AI by controlling them. Each has its own unique movement mechanics and capabilities.

SUPEREGO manipulates gravity.
