{"about_the_game":"The E-flite\u00ae Carbon-Z T-28 Trojan 2.0m was one of the first-ever large-scale, fully molded foam warbird models available. To this day, it's still one of the largest foam warbird models to ever hit the market, offering convenience and flight performance unmatched by similar-sized models constructed of any material. Due to popular demand, this latest version of the CZ T-28 has been updated and upgraded with Smart electronics, more durable and reliable retracts, LED landing and navigation lights, plus a fully painted finish to deliver a &quot;giant scale&quot; warbird experience you simply can't get from any other model. Its legendary flight performance makes it easy to fly, even by low-time pilots who have only flown smaller warbird models, while also offering plenty of capability for even the most demanding pilots. That makes it a perfect choice for intermediate to experienced pilots interested in a convenient, capable, and easy to fly large-scale model of one of the most popular and recognizable military trainer aircraft ever!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is equipped with Horizon Hobby and Spektrum exclusive AS3X (Artificial Stabilization \u2013 3-aXis) and optional-use SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) Select technologies, and when SAFE Select is turned on using the mode switch (B on the Spektrum InterLink DX controller) it offers:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPitch and Bank Angle Limits<br />\r\nThese envelope limits keep the airplane from rolling or pitching upside down.
