{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Sky King's Tomb AP 1: Mantle of Gold<br> <br> Invited to a prestigious storytelling festival in Highhelm, the greatest dwarven city, a clan's eclectic guests explore every corner of the metropolis to build their own legends. Yet when these budding celebrities find a relic linked to one of dwarvenkind's greatest heroes, they're drawn into a mysterious ancient urban intrigue that kicks off a deadly treasure hunt. <br> <br> Mantle of Gold is a Pathfinder adventure for four 1st-level characters. This adventure begins the Sky King's Tomb Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a group of adventurers travel deep underground to discover a legendary dwarven king's tomb, seek subterranean treasures, and heal millennia-old injustices--all while stopping an ambitious villain from weaponizing those same discoveries. This adventure also includes a detailed look at lost dwarven treasures, tricks for adventuring in the dark, potent relics, and several monsters to threaten underground explorers. <br> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
