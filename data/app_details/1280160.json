Race through a variety of environments against <strong>ruthless computer opponents</strong>, and prove your driving skills once and for all against the infamous <strong>rubber-banding AI</strong>. If solo gaming isn't your thing, why not break a few friendships with our <strong>multiplayer modes</strong>? Race or battle against up to three of your soon-to-be enemies, and enjoy some banging tunes by musical artist Saury and Luan Maziero!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1280160/extras/giphy-(3).gif?t=1594928338\" /><br><br><strong>Rigorous Races</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Your racing adventure starts on the mysterious Red Rock Island.
