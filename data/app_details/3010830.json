{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description</h2><br>A casual turn-based card game based on the rules of Trash or Garbage. A classic card sequencing game that involves organizing a hand Ace through Ten in sequential order before your opponent can. After you complete a round, you will start the next round with one fewer cards to complete in your sequence. Play continues until you have won ten rounds. The game comes complete with a tutorial to teach you the basics, and introduces a variant 'Trash Battle' mode to the game. This mode adds a bit more strategy and allows you to mess with your opponents cards and not simply just completing your own hand. You can play against a basic AI opponent or in local competitive mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Local Multiplayer</h2><br>Play with a friend in local multiplayer mode. Local multiplayer requires two distinct input devices to play. Currently Keyboard/Mouse for one player, and a controller for the second player.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Trash the AI","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3010830/a5f339a06a64d2790b016284251dcb4f9b3259b8.jpg"},{"name":"Battle the AI","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3010830/1fdcb93eb6ae14e451e51bf3255b1bb41eaeed02.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Tutorial","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3010830/25e2caf5d982fc3c59c8e73f566065ac7543286c.jpg"},{"name":"Her Majesty Rules","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3010830/de24f1dc346366b74146c72cfd15997ee2601242.jpg"},{"name":"King of Thieves","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3010830/cf932f10b7db643f1443dcc08b36107f0b82c64e.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725764970","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725764970","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725764970","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725764970","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Description</h2><br>A casual turn-based card game based on the rules of Trash or Garbage.
