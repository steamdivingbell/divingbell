{"about_the_game":"Digital City is a novel simulator intended to support local authorities representatives and urban planners in their day-to-day work. Functioning as a true-to-life digital twin, Digital City replicates real-world traffic scenarios, allowing users to build, test and refine their ideas before implementing them in cities around the world.<br />\r\nLeveraging the power of the Unreal engine, Digital City\u2019s simulations are highly life-like and photorealistic. The simulator creates visualizations of traffic flows, pedestrian movement, and transit operations in unprecedented detail, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-world dynamics. Furthermore, the simulator creates an immersive user experience where users will experience the urban landscape from the perspectives of various traffic participants, such as pedestrians, car drivers, public transport operators, cyclists, and other stakeholders. This unique feature provides valuable insights into each group\u2019s potential challenges and needs within the urban environment.<br />\r\nTransform how urban planning is conducted with Digital City and unlock the potential of future-ready cities. Harness the power of immersive simulations to design urban environments which prioritize sustainability, safety, and quality of life for all citizens. Experience the future of urban planning today!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1690189413","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482490/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1690189413","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1690189413","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2482490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1690189413","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Digital City is a novel simulator intended to support local authorities representatives and urban planners in their day-to-day work.
