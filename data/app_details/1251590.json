The music adheres to a thrilling atmosphere, which works great for the game. Although the music sometimes is a bit too present at times in the game, it definitely puts the player in this puzzling environment. The music doesn't get boring, but instead wants to be heard multiple times, which is important for game music. As a personal favorite I would pick &quot;I Was Terrified&quot;, but every track is well composed and worth a listen.\u201d<br>ZenithMusicNet<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251590/ss_dc3d518fb821b20e108e4b488b47d00a66637b75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583624300","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251590/ss_dc3d518fb821b20e108e4b488b47d00a66637b75.600x338.jpg?t=1583624300"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251590/ss_dc3d518fb821b20e108e4b488b47d00a66637b75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1583624300","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1251590/ss_dc3d518fb821b20e108e4b488b47d00a66637b75.600x338.jpg?t=1583624300"}],"short_description":"Enjoy the music of Session Seven on your own.
