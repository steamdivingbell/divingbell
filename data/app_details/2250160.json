{"about_the_game":"You are John D. Pedal, a man who lived a normal life. He had a nice job, had a nice house, and had a goldfish, named Ted. One day, aliens struck from another world! The great worm drained the world from all of its water, and Ted was captured. Set in the Mojave, several bounties have been placed against the great worm. Several factions have gathered to destroy the worm, and claim their prize. John D. Pedal is a lone wolf in this world, and only cares about finding his goldfish, Ted. <br><br><strong>Driving and Shooting</strong><br><br>Dead Pedal is all about driving and shooting. You'll have the ability to quickly zoom around the world at fast speeds. You will have 2 weapons to choose from, including a mini-gun, and laser cannon. Your goal is to destroy everything in your way, including enemy cars, faction bases, and the great worm. Your weapons can become stronger as you destroy new faction bases, increasing your chance to destroy the big worm.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2250160/extras/DrivingAndShooting2New.gif?t=1683296400\" /><br><br><strong>Open World</strong><br><br>You are free to explore whatever you can see in Dead Pedal.
