In a harsh winter many years ago the orcish hordes of the West assaulted Great Oakendom and caught the wise elves unprepared. A brave Elvari queen went to seek help from the Alliance\u2019s closest neighbors. Many noble knights, soldiers and even common villagers answered her call. She led them in a thunderous counter-attack against the raging invaders. Men and Nature fought together this day to protect the forest, and they emerged victorious!</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content</h2>One preconstructed deck - Soldier Reverence (1 hero + 60 cards)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplan</h2>Assault your enemies with tough and versatile soldiers with this deck.
