Each player starts with different colored poker chips equal to half the number of cards in the grid. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>PLAY</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Play is in turns.  A player puts his poker chip on a previously un-played card in the grid and decides if the chosen card will be played FACE UP or FACE DOWN (discussed later herein).  The player's poker chip remains on the card for the duration of the game, and that card cannot be chosen by any player again. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After the poker chip is placed, the player's &quot;hand score&quot; and &quot;bonus score&quot; are added together to make the player's total score for the turn, which is then added to the player's cumulative score for the game.  The next player does the same.  This continues until each player no longer has any chips, at which point the game ends and the player with the highest cumulative score wins.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CALCULATING THE PLAYER'S &quot;HAND SCORE&quot;</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A player's &quot;hand score&quot; is a point total corresponding to the best poker hand in the <strong>scoring area</strong>.\u00a0 The <strong>scoring area</strong> consists of the chosen card and the adjacent surrounding FACE UP cards, whether previously played or not.\u00a0 The <strong>scoring area</strong> is illustrated as follows (solid card is the chosen card):</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Chosen card not at edge or corner (9 card scoring area): </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2592 \u2592 \u2592 <br>\u2592 \u2588 \u2592 <br>\u2592 \u2592 \u2592 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Chosen card at edge but not a corner (6 card scoring area, example below is right edge):</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2592 \u2592  <br>\u2592 \u2588  <br>\u2592 \u2592 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Chosen card at corner (4 card scoring area, example below is upper left corner): </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2588 \u2592  <br>\u2592 \u2592 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Previously played FACE DOWN cards in the <strong>scoring area</strong> cannot be used for the player's poker hand. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">If the chosen card is played FACE DOWN, it is scored as a <i>wild card</i> (any card, any suit) for that player's turn only, but is not scored thereafter on later turns by either player.  As mentioned, previously played FACE DOWN cards are &quot;dead&quot; for the remainder of the game for both players. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For the &quot;hand score&quot;, points are awarded as follows: </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">PAIR = 2 points <br>TWO PAIR = 4 points <br>THREE OF A KIND = 5 points <br>STRAIGHT (all 5 cards consecutive) = 7 points <br>FLUSH (all 5 cards same suit) = 8 points <br>FULL HOUSE (pair + three of a kind) = 9 points <br>FOUR OF A KIND = 10 points <br>STRAIGHT FLUSH (5 consecutive cards of the same suit) = 11 points </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>CALCULATING THE PLAYER'S &quot;BONUS SCORE&quot;</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The player's &quot;bonus score&quot; is based on the chosen card's proximity to the player's previously-placed poker chips on FACE UP cards within the same <strong>scoring area</strong> used for the &quot;hand score&quot;.  Bonus points for adjacent poker chips are scored as indicated below (solid card is the chosen card): </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">1 2  1 <br>2 \u2588 2 <br>1 2  1 </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As with the &quot;hand score&quot; <strong>scoring area</strong>, if the chosen card is at an edge or corner of the grid, the &quot;bonus score&quot; <strong>scoring area</strong> is reduced accordingly.  The minimum &quot;bonus score&quot; per turn is &quot;0&quot; and the maximum is &quot;12&quot; (2+2+2+2+1+1+1+1).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>BASIC STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A winning strategy obviously involves selecting the best poker hands.\u00a0 Moving past that, the most common impactful decision made throughout the game is choosing between (1) FACE DOWN moves that often produce a higher score on the turn in which they are selected but prevent or reduce future \u201cbonus scores\u201d; and (2) FACE UP moves that often have a lower score on the turn in which they are selected, BUT may enable or enhance the player\u2019s \u201cbonus scores\u201d on future moves.\u00a0 Other strategic considerations include blocking or stealing an opponent\u2019s moves; and/or trading slightly better \u201chand scores\u201d for lower scoring \u201chand scores\u201d in more favorable locations on the grid (usually more toward the middle, and/or within the center of high scoring clusters that are harder for an opponent to use, steal or block).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>ADDRESSING THE PLAYER 1 (FIRST MOVE) ADVANTAGE</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Player 1 (the player who goes first) has a win percentage advantage which increases with smaller grids. To make HUMAN vs. HUMAN games fair, consider doing the following: (a) play 2 games alternating who goes first and combine each player\u2019s scores over those 2 games to determine the winner; or (b) just keep playing until someone wins as Player 2 (first player to \u201cbreak serve\u201d wins, to use a tennis term and analogy).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Similarly, to enhance your challenge against the computer, play as Player 2 on smaller grids.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>STEAM'S REMOTE PLAY TOGETHER - PLAY NEARLY ANYONE ANYWHERE ANYTIME</strong> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Remote Play Together (built into Steam) is available in-game through the Steam Overlay (SHIFT+ALT). </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Remote Play Together works nicely with LOCUS POKER's HUMAN vs. HUMAN mode.
