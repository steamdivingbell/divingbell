{"about_the_game":"Supergalactix is a fast-paced strategic planet-conquering game, where you strive for galactic dominance. Its core mechanics are fairly simple, but as in chess, the game becomes very complex once you learn all of its aspects and progress through the campaign. As a spiritual successor to an old web based game (Intergalactics) it can be described in similar terms: a galactic chess.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAim of the game is to conquer all enemy planets on the map. Each planet has its own production value, which dictates the speed of ship production. You can send ships off of your planet to any other planet - if target planet is enemy, a battle will commence once ships arrive at the planet. In case of your own planets or that of allies, those planets get reinforced by the ships you send to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlanets under your control can be upgraded (depending on the game mode) - with production, defense or radar upgrades. Upgrades can make ship production faster, increase defense value of the planet or construct radars on planet that will reveal any enemy movements close to the planet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSupergalactix offers different game modes. In some your ships will be able to travel via hyper tunnels using Hyper engine (fastest way of travelling in the game), in some only using Warp engines or both, in some enemy movements will be visible in others not, in some planet upgrades will be allowed. Game mechanics may also be adjusted with skirmish games (game speed, ship costs, ships per fleet, and much more). The game offers variety of custom settings to adjust to your favourite play style and difficulty level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Supergalactix game can last from a couple of minutes to up to an hour or more. Play it with your pace - casually or by progressing through campaign, tournaments, online play and more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for many hours of fun! :)","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2398130?t=1702779476","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398130/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1702779476","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702779476","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2398130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702779476","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Supergalactix is a fast-paced strategic planet-conquering game, where you strive for galactic dominance.
