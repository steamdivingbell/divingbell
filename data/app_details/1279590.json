This news was sobering and fascinating at the same time. Sobering in the sense that the decades old tradition of chess programming had been relegated to the shadows by a self-learning system.

The advantage: with some decisions and a few clicks you can set up a useable repertoire.

Helpful for practice is also the fact that in your drilling when you reach the end of a variation you can decide if you want to carry on as a training game.
