You are the famous filibuster Duncan Ironbrow, who was unexpectedly dragged into &quot;big politics&quot;. You are destined to become a hero of the Battle for Independence of Samreignia. Two story missions, plus one Endless Mode exclusive map layout await you.

Over 25 THOUSAND enemies will assault your castle walls. Every arrow, catapult stone and enemy launched skywards is physically modeled, making for a tactile and coherent battlefield. Just make sure your troops have towers to shoot from and clear lines of sight, or you might find your best-laid plans embarrassingly blunted by your own fortifications. Create kill-zones and fall-back positions.
