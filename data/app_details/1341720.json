{"about_the_game":"<strong>Alt254 is a minimalistic open-world action-adventure and exploration game.</strong> You are \u25a0. The world around you is a mystery -- you don't know friend from enemy, safe from dangerous. You have to embark on a journey of exploration and self-discovery, and overcome all kinds of dangers, enemies and hazards, to understand what's going on... and maybe find the meaning behind all this.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1341720/extras/a2.gif?t=1683819458\" /><br><br>Set out on a fascinating minimalistic adventure where you will explore an open world, full of surprises and enigmas, where every location is different and brings its own challenges.

Heart-stopping adventures and terrifying monsters are expressed with a single pixel.
