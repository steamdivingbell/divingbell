Explore a powerful 3D node-based logic system that lets you create intricate, interactive networks where nodes send, process, and respond to messages. With a top-down design approach, you can connect nodes to build complex workflows, customizable interactions, and dynamic data structures. In addition, data is visible out in the world and is able to be given a 3D mesh to assist in remembering data by associating visually with it with what is known as the 'loci method'. In essence you store your data place it in the world and make connections to enhance your own learning capabilities.\u00a0</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Node Network Design</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Nodes</strong>: Each node holds a message and prompt, sending its message to connected nodes when triggered.
