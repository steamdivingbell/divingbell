Race along Northeast Corridor rails in iconic style, reaching incredible speeds through multiple states and suburbs. \u201cTrain approaching, please remain behind yellow line\u201d, Amtrak\u2019s Acela\u00ae blasts into Train Sim World 3!<br><br>Celebrate American rail with the Train Sim World 3: US Super Bundle!<br><br>Operate Amtrak\u2019s flagship service on the Northeast Corridor. Beginning in 2000, the Acela service offers the fastest and most direct connection with the principal states that make-up the East Coast of the US. Competing directly with air travel, the Acela service features Business Class and First Class accommodations, and makes easy work of the route, being able to reach speeds, on limited sections, up to 150 mph. <br><br>The Acela trainset itself is a marvel of engineering. First taking shape in the late 1990s, the design is heavily derived from the famed TGV, albeit with changes to meet US requirements. The intermediate coaches are equipped with active tilting technology, easing the strain on passengers on tighter corners, allowing for travel at higher speeds. A total of 20 Acela trainsets were built specifically for use on the Northeast Corridor, carrying thousands of people every day.<br><br>Although next generation Acela II equipment is planned to start replacing the original Acela trains in the future, you can forever climb aboard this iconic trainset in Train Sim World 3!
