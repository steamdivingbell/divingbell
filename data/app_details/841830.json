{"about_the_game":"Semi-Sweet Tofu is a 2D side scrolling platformer game where players have to eat fruit to survive along with using the color you change while eating the fruit to defeat the enemies you are faced with. We took things from other games and modified them such as \u201cDon\u2019t Starve\u201d when you have to eat to survive and added another mechanic too that he fruit you eat to survive also give buffs to the player as well as useful to survive and progress. You have to jump on platforms and use certain fruit such as the apple which gives you a higher jump height to reach certain platforms or the banana fruit which gives you movement speed so you can jump further or run away from the magician. The core of the gameplay relies on the fruit and the ability to use them in a unique way. You can throw fruit at enemies to stun them as well as collide with them to destroy them. If you\u2019re not the same color as the enemy you\u2019ll take damage but if you are the same color you\u2019ll destroy the enemy without taking damage.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/841830/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1525379683","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/841830/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1525379683","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/841830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1525379683","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/841830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1525379683","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Semi-Sweet Tofu is a 2D side scrolling platformer game where players have to eat fruit to survive along with using the color you change while eating the fruit to defeat the enemies you are faced with.
