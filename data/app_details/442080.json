Players use a range of weapons and magic spells in intense battles, leading to graphic effects like explosions, flashes, and some blood effects upon hitting enemies. While not excessively graphic, the violence is more intense than in typical youth-oriented games.\r\n\r\nDark Themes and Scenarios: The storyline and quests may include themes of betrayal, revenge, and conflict between different factions or species. Some quests involve tracking down or confronting monstrous beings, which may feel intense or frightening.\r\n\r\nSuggestive Content: Certain character designs, especially for female characters, include revealing armor or outfits. This aesthetic choice can add a suggestive element to the game, though it\u2019s not a central aspect of gameplay.\r\n\r\nMild Language: The dialogue and chat in Riders of Icarus sometimes include mild profanity or language that might be considered offensive."},"detailed_description":"<h1>Echoes of Hakanas NOW LIVE</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/442080/extras/Stream_main_616x353.jpg?t=1734322178\" /><br><br>Forgotten was the Golden Age of Exarahn, Hadakhan - The king of the Exarahn Kingdom was the one to lead his people to the Golden Age 2000 years ago, all was flourished and everything was advancing rapidly, but all of it changed when they were invaded by the Imperial Legion, it was chaos and nightmares.<br><br>Read the full patch notes here: </p><br><h1>Shadow of Turimnan Now Live</h1><p><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/442080/extras/turimnan_616x353.jpg?t=1734322178\" /><br><br>On the way to destroy the Demonic Stone once and for all, our fearless hero gets caught between a war that has lasted for decades in an ancient land called Turimnan.
