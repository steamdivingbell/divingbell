{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About this game</h2><br>Havoc Horizons acts similarly to most other war strategy games but its key mechanic sets it far apart from the norm. Unlike most other games of this type, when a fight for land takes place players are put into a first-person shooter battle and must fight out the war in a chaotic but tactical way. War room strategic skills and first-person shooter skills are used in this game letting the player feel like they are leading a nation as well as supporting it on the frontlines.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br>Classes:<br>There are many classes of troops in this game ranging from infantry to bomber drones allowing every match to be unique and interesting.<br><br>Maps:<br>There are plenty of maps to play on that change based on the current situation of the board. Starting a war in a desert? You better believe you will have to endure what comes with that.<br><br>Multiplayer:<br>Play in matches with up to four people making games more chaotic with constant action. There is also no need to worry about waiting on the sidelines during battles as players will team up with others to crush their enemy.<br><br>Chapters:<br>Havoc Horizons will be receiving consistent content updates allowing for multiple eras of combat to be experienced. At any point a player can decide which era they want to play in whether that be modern-day, World War 2, and so on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Development</h2><br>This game's development will be continually updated after release with new chapters being added consistently, and an action-packed story coming to follow that.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2921410/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1723855256","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2921410/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1723855256","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2921410/be38102415734926aad25884f31506ccbc11202c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1723855256","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2921410/be38102415734926aad25884f31506ccbc11202c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1723855256","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This Game contains content based around war and displays light virtual violence there's no gore or blood but player's bodies fall upon death."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About this game</h2><br>Havoc Horizons acts similarly to most other war strategy games but its key mechanic sets it far apart from the norm.
