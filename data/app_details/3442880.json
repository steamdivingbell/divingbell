Rather than trying to split the difference between casual players and those that enjoy a time management challenge, it offers two gameplay modes:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Casual Mode, you have as much time each day as you like, and you can play at your own pace to complete the game by meeting certain story objectives.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In Serious Mode, each day has a time limit, and you have two in-game years to reach your goal of gathering enough faith through Minoriko's farming operation. Some additional hurdles to make resource management more robust are added as well.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There's more to planning out your farm than just aesthetics! You can't walk through your crops after they've sprouted, so you'll need to plan their placement with care, but your tools can upgrade their area of effect in many ways to suit whatever layout you please. You can build terraces to grow rice and other aquatic crops, as well as lay out an irrigation system through hoses and sprinklers with a variety of patterns.\u00a0 Players that enjoy a light engineering challenge will find themselves at home here.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Various side sources of income such as fishing and mining are available, but if you want some real excitement, head into Youkai Mountain's adventure zones for some shooting action and loot! <i>(Note: In development, no screenshots yet!)</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The nearby Yasaka Resort Town and surrounding Youkai Mountain feature a large number of the eccentric (and notoriously combative) characters Touhou is known for, but what's a farm sim without a bit of romance?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3442880/extras/gfs.png?t=1737142708\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><i>Hot youkai women in YOUR area!</i></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With a bit of work on your part, you can take one of the local ladies on a date, hang out together as they follow you around, and even bring them along in adventure zones! Once you've grown close enough, and you've built your house with the right amenities to suit their needs, you'll even be able to get one (or more!) of them to move in with you.
