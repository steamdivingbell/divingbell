The roulette has three layers, each with a different multiplier. Attack power is not displayed as it is by the number on the roulette, but is displayed as the combined attack power of all elements including the player's level and other elements. The roulette can only be spun when the yellow bar is full. Also, as you deal damage to enemies, the blue bar will increase, and when it is full, the roulette layer will change.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Fight the enemy.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enemies attack using two types of magic. Guidance magic and magic that deploys a magic circle near the enemy. Enemy attacks and tornadoes can be defended with a shield. You cannot attack while using a shield. Bat transformation: If you receive an enemy attack while in bat transformation, you can stun the attacking enemy. However, bat transformation consumes some stamina. Some enemies cannot be damaged unless you deal a certain amount of damage.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>\u25a0Collect hats.</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">When you defeat an enemy, they sometimes drop a hat.
