If you\u2019re a seasoned player of the Nancy Drew mysteries, I think you\u2019ll be pleased with this entertaining title. If you\u2019re a new player, looking for the perfect game out of the 32 to get started with, I\u2019d highly recommend this one as a prime example of the quality of the series. The price point is well worth the hours of enjoyment you\u2019ll receive from solving a mystery alongside the most famous young female detective of all time. So grab a copy and, as Her Interactive challenges you to do in the opening titles, \u201cDare to Play.\u201d\u201d<br>Computer Times<br><br>\u201cOverall I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The game looks better than I expected, had an interesting story, and difficult puzzles that kept me in to the game. While this style of game may not be everyone\u2019s favorite, for those who do enjoy it this game comes highly recommended. Even those who are not as interested in the genre should check this game out, and will probably enjoy it like I did.\u201d<br>PoisonKiwi<br><br>\u201cOverall Sea of Darkness was an enjoyable game, especially if you enjoy \u201cbrain teaser\u201d puzzles that are more challenging than what\u2019s found in today\u2019s casual games.\u201d<br>GameBoomers<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_a49bba6aca6ed8d5fe361096127fd8646e853f22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_a49bba6aca6ed8d5fe361096127fd8646e853f22.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_9d8851b552d916c415ae23c3fb5bdda1b4732ec0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_9d8851b552d916c415ae23c3fb5bdda1b4732ec0.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_00bb84cdec5b98f71f381ade2fccffd90971fc8c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_00bb84cdec5b98f71f381ade2fccffd90971fc8c.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_31e08bb84478d69769d329aacf85ca1cc9f99d78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_31e08bb84478d69769d329aacf85ca1cc9f99d78.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_f8f1bce878165734e0ffc916b9ce863921d1894a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_f8f1bce878165734e0ffc916b9ce863921d1894a.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_d49f089dfff064e987852fa314ae2aa54398e64d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_d49f089dfff064e987852fa314ae2aa54398e64d.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_47cb0933aa21b9e2bbfc2e9a44e9ecef5a9269bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_47cb0933aa21b9e2bbfc2e9a44e9ecef5a9269bf.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_466c1bd80d2471ba6d3a0e767f6863907f0402aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_466c1bd80d2471ba6d3a0e767f6863907f0402aa.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_54527b1853cb234840d05bd0bfee0b16f86c798f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_54527b1853cb234840d05bd0bfee0b16f86c798f.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_2140479b01ae9f839f77bc4aa62485ac1af459f2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_2140479b01ae9f839f77bc4aa62485ac1af459f2.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_5ff9e8b480d83fc149e34bea5dcd7ad15d58f67a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734463423","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/572700/ss_5ff9e8b480d83fc149e34bea5dcd7ad15d58f67a.600x338.jpg?t=1734463423"}],"short_description":"Set a Course for Danger and Discovery!","steam_appid":572700,"support_info":{"email":"techsupport@herinteractive.com","url":"http://www.herinteractive.com/support/contact-support/"},"supported_languages":"English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support","type":"game","website":"http://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-sea-of-darkness/"}
