It includes a Killer, The Executioner, a Survivor, Cheryl Mason, and a Map. Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive Universal Charm: the Seal of Metatron. <br><br>The Silent Hill Chapter includes a new map, Midwich Elementary School:  the childhood trauma that once took place in its halls has since manifested itself into a twisted, nightmarish design.  The new Killer is The Executioner: take control of Pyramid Head and wield his great knife to unleash his twisted brand of punishment on all who cross him. The new Survivor is Cheryl Mason, a courageous, outspoken woman who survived the hellish Otherworld of Silent Hill, and exacted revenge on the Order that killed her father. With experience beyond her years, she's prepared to once again stand against any evil that confronts her.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_Killer_header.png?t=1681934376\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Executioner</h2><br>A sadistic and merciless executioner, Pyramid Head is fixated on dispensing punishment through pain. Encumbered by the steel frame upon his head and with a hulking great blade in tow, he stalked the hellish corridors of Silent Hill, committed to a duty that no one truly understood. Where he trod, even monsters fled for the shadows, and those who crossed his path fell victim to unrestrained acts of aggression. When his duty was complete and his presence no longer needed, he prepared for the long rest\u2014and yet, his skills were required elsewhere. The fog that streamed over him was somehow different than that he was accustomed to in Silent Hill, as if each wisp contained the nerves of a creature, writhing, seeking him out. There was an unspoken agreement in that moment. The billowing cloud was an invitation to duty and sadism, and Pyramid Head, taking a step into the fog, accepted his obligation once more. <br><br><strong>The Executioner\u2019s Power: Rites of Judgement</strong><br><br>Press and hold the Power button to activate. Once activated, move in any direction to carve a trail into the ground. Release the button to finish carving. Survivors who walk or run on the trail will trigger Killer Instinct and be afflicted with Torment. Survivors under the effect of Torment may be sent to a Cage of Atonement by The Executioner while they are in the dying state. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_Killer_Perks_header.png?t=1681934376\" /><br><br>The Executioner comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Forced Penance</h2>Those who stand in the way of duty will suffer harsh judgment. <br>Survivors who take a protection hit are inflicted with the Broken status effect for 40/50/60 seconds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Trail of Torment</h2>You guide your victims along a path of pain and punishment. After kicking a generator, you become Undetectable for 16/16/16 seconds. During this time, the generator\u2019s yellow aura is revealed to Survivors. This effect can only trigger once every 80/70/60 seconds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deathbound</h2>Those whose lives are intertwined in darkness are destined to suffer together. When a Survivor heals another Survivor for one health state at least 32/32/32 meters away from the Killer, the Survivor performing the healing action will scream, revealing their location and activating Deathbound for the next 60/60/60 seconds. During that time, the Survivor will suffer from the Oblivious status effect when further than 16/12/8 meters away from the healed Survivor. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_Survivor_header.png?t=1681934376\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cheryl Mason</h2><br>Caring and impulsive, Cheryl Mason, previously known as Heather, attempted to rebuild her life after the tragic death of her adoptive father, Harry Mason. While she had freed herself from the religious cult that pursued her since birth, she was shackled by the guilt of her father's death. A darkness punished her every night under the guise of abominable nightmares. <br><br>To ease her conscience, she volunteered at a crisis intervention center for troubled youth. Three months later, she aced training and could answer the crisis line without supervision. Yet little could have prepared her for the first call. All she heard was static. The air thickened as black fumes rose from the ground and suddenly she heard the voice of a woman\u2014someone she thought she'd never hear from again. Why do you cling to this corrupt world? You know that only God can save us. It couldn't be her\u2014Claudia was dead. Suddenly, the world spun and she dropped on her knees, nauseous. Hot bile traveled up her throat and she retched warm blood on the floor. Then the spinning stopped as swiftly as it began. Cheryl looked up and saw she was somewhere else. A cold, hopeless place.  <br><br>Cheryl comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Soul Guard </h2>You have been through immense hardship and you\u2019re stronger for it. Gain the Endurance status effect for 4/6/8 seconds after being healed or having recovered from the dying state. During this time, any damage that will put you in the dying state will instead apply Deep Wounds. You have 20/20/20 seconds to mend yourself. If you take any damage while affected by Deep Wounds, or if the timer ends, you are immediately put in the dying state. While cursed by a hex, you can fully recover from the dying state.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Blood Pact</h2>It\u2019s as if a latent part of yourself has awakened. You feel like you can reach out beyond yourself for assistance. When you or the Obsession are injured, you both see each other's auras. After healing the Obsession or being healed by the Obsession, you both gain a 7/7/7% Haste status effect for 6/8/10 seconds. Reduces the odds of being the Obsession. If you are the Obsession, this perk deactivates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Repressed Alliance</h2>You\u2019re accustomed to being hunted by malicious forces, and you\u2019ve begun using it to your advantage. Repressed Alliance activates after repairing generators for a total of 80/70/60 seconds. When repairing a generator while the perk is active, press the Active Ability button to call upon the Entity to block the generator for 30/30/30 seconds. The perk deactivates. Affected generators will be revealed by a white aura to all Survivors.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_Map_header.png?t=1681934376\" /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Map: Midwich Elementary School</h2></strong><br>To students who were bullied by their teachers and classmates, attending Midwich Elementary School was comparable to torture. As the Order\u2019s grip on the town\u2019s supernatural energies tightened, a transformation occurred. The childhood trauma that took place in the building manifested itself into a twisted, nightmarish design. Though desks and textbooks remain, they\u2019re eerily contrasted with stained walls, rusted chains, and hanging cadavers. Any notion that this could have been a place of innocence and learning has long since faded. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_ExclItem.png?t=1681934376\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exclusive Charm</h2>The Silent Hill Chapter includes an exclusive item: the Seal of Metatron, a Universal Charm, only available as part of the DLC.
