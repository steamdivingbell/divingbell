Humans and Dragons. At the highest point of tension between the two one-man, knight, and a father named Ronin tries to protect the Dragons from a one-sided setup that will lead to mass extinction. To stop Ronin his friend and fellow knight betrays and kills him. Ronin is branded a traitor to the public, and the truth of his death remains a secret. Ronin\u2019s family, a wife, baby son, and kid daughter, leave their home to escape the daily harassment. <br><br>14 years later, that same baby son, Zale, now a teenager has stumbled upon one of the last Dragons left. She entrusts Zale with her power. It allows Zale to peer into other people\u2019s hearts and live, feel, and understand their trauma. Zale and his sister decide they should use this power to help people who are in trouble, misunderstood, and even the same types of people who called their father a traitor. To them, the only way to do that is to do what their father did and become knights. Unknowing to them following under the very man who killed their father. Will Zale and his sister be able to change society for the better, or will they end up like their father?\u00a0<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2312560/extras/Gameplay.png?t=1706527060\" /><br>You\u2019ll play as Zale as he tries to connect with people. You\u2019ll do this by helping them with favors like planting flowers, hide &amp; seek, delivering love letters, and much more! There will be times when you\u2019ll need to be a good listener and empathize and other times need to be honest with the person. The most optimistic people tell uncomfortable truths because they believe people can change. So don\u2019t conflate being blunt with pessimism. Just be gentle and empathetic with others and try to tell them what they need to hear.\u2028<br><br>\u2028Along with helping the townsfolk, Zale will attend the Knight Academy, where he will learn how to use a sword and use elemental magic. He\u2019s told that monsters are the greatest threat to humanity, but is that really the whole truth? Monsters, just like the humans in the game have problems of their own so when you engage in combat, you\u2019ll have to save the monsters or give in to the knights and do what you\u2019re told.
