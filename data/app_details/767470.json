{"about_the_game":"<i>Centuries have passed since Uros disappeared, and relations among his descendants have remained relatively peaceful. However, they will soon realize that a peace based on mutual hate is a fragile one indeed.</i><br><br>Creatio Ex Nihilo II: Deus Otiosus continues the story that began in the first game. Time has passed, and the void left by Uros have been bigger than anticipated. A ruler of the universe was picked, but the choice did not amuse everyone, to put it mildly. Feelings of ambition, hate, and envy are hiding just below the surface of most of the divine beings. A confrontation on a universal scale is brewing. Everyone is vying for the ultimate power in a war that will tear apart families, and destroy mortal worlds in its path. You will take on the role of one of Uros' descendants, and it is up to you to decide whether you will try to take the power for yourself, or if you will attempt to end the war in a more peaceful manner. However, you will soon realize that the actions of you and your family might just awaken a threat much bigger than you ever bargained for.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Action RPG<br></li><li> Immersive Storyline <br></li><li> Choices That Matter</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/767470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736800106","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/767470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1736800106","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/767470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736800106","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/767470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736800106","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Centuries have passed since Uros disappeared, and relations among his descendants have remained relatively peaceful.
