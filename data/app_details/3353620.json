After the battle of Beiting, Liuzhongcheng in Xizhou, today's Turpan Basin.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tubo was the Protectorate of the Northern Court, and the Anxi Road was cut off. The people of Duxi Prefecture were still the governors of the Tang Dynasty</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Uyghur Khanate, which originally sheltered the local area, was previously defeated by Tubo, and the Tang Dynasty's fiefdoms in the Central Plains were numerous, making it impossible for them to return to the Western Regions. The military and civilians in Xizhou had to do their best to find their own way out.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Until the ninth year of the Zhenyuan reign of the Tang Dynasty... last year, Xizhou fell rapidly</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2026\u2026</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After the outbreak of the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang court was powerless and deployed troops from Anxi to quell the rebellion. The various forces in the Western Regions had ulterior motives, and the long planned Tubo launched an offensive. The war lasted for decades. Two years ago, in the Battle of Beiting, Tibet won a great victory, and Liuzhong City became the last stronghold of the Tang army in Xizhou, and also the last nail on the local military map of Tibet. In order to remove this thorn from their eyes, Tubo summoned a large army to attack Liuzhong. In the city, Captain Li Yan worries day and night about the food and horses, while the Grand Historian Wen Qinli is still thinking about how to endure all of this with the teachings of the sages and the rules of etiquette and law; Li Si'an, the second son of Li Yan, runs around the city every day, hoping to find a foothold for himself and lead the people through this disaster. However, his sister Yun'er is trapped by her forgotten mother and often cold father. At this moment, a ragged old man of a different race pulled a young girl and fled into this city. Everything was surging in the midst of it. Where would the fate of this city go?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Li Yan: As the commander-in-chief of Puchang Zhechong Prefecture, at the age of 47, he was defeated by the invasion of Tubo and eventually retreated to Liuzhong City, preparing to defend. However, facing the deteriorating situation of the river and river, he was more interested in finding a way out for the people in the city than defending a city for the Tang Dynasty.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Wen Qinli: Pu Chang was appointed as the Chief Historian of Chongfu, and served in the Ming Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Suzong. At the age of fifty-three, he not only dealt with various documents, but also devoted himself to education, striving to preserve the cultural foundation of the Han people with all his might. He constantly worried about the collapse of his thoughts, hoping that the sage's ideas could eventually save this city from fire and water.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Zhao Shangwu: A lieutenant under the Puchang army, at the age of eighteen. His father was saved by Li Yan and he was also his confidant. I am extremely grateful for Li Yan's kindness and loyal, but at the same time, I am also a good friend of Li Sian, and they face difficulties in both aspects of their family affairs.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Qixin Er: The captured Tibetan priestess, according to her, was never welcomed in Tibet. Her thoughts are diverse, and she has unique perspectives on the times and human nature in her eyes. Buddha's words: Bodhi mind is the cause, sorrow is the root, and convenience is the ultimate goal.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Li Sian: Li Yan's second son, at the age of eighteen, is currently studying under Wen Qinli. He is both dissatisfied and fearful of his father, but also hopes to be recognized by him. His elder brother, who died in battle, became an unavoidable knot in his heart. Now he is running around the city, trying his best to do something, but it seems that nothing can be changed?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Li Yun'er: Li Yan's eldest daughter, the third in the family and the last child of Li Yan. She is fourteen years old and has been weak and sickly since childhood. She realizes that her mother passed away because of her, and her father's avoidance of this has made her increasingly curious about all of this. She is curious about her mother and her father, and even more curious about how all of this actually developed to this point. However, these questions have not yet been answered.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Liu Yue'er: A young girl who was caught in the city while gasping for breath in the war. She claimed to be the daughter of an old friend of Li Yan, at the age of sixteen, but seemed to hide a different identity and motive. The current situation is complex and intricate, and she is equally enigmatic.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u2026\u2026</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0</p><p
