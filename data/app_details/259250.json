When the scientists lose control, a small team of elite soldiers must retrieve the intel and exterminate hordes of savage creatures while surviving a three-story tall terror unlike anything they\u2019ve faced before. Featuring two all-new species of aliens and an exclusive weapon, Episode 1: Nightfall is a fast &amp; frenetic, action-packed continuation of the Extinction experience.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/259250/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447359151","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/259250/page.bg.jpg?t=1447359151","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/259250/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447359151","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/259250/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447359151","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled","id":8},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Welcome to Onslaught, the first downloadable content pack for Call of Duty\u00ae: Ghosts, featuring four unique Multiplayer Maps, an all-new dual purpose Assault Rifle/Sniper Rifle, and the first installment in Extinction\u2019s four-part episodic narrative.  <br><br>Complementing the fun, fast-paced multiplayer experience that gamers have come to expect, Onslaught delivers four classically designed Call of Duty\u00ae multiplayer maps, each with their own distinct environments, scale, and gameplay variety.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fog (Washington, USA): A dark and eerie campsite set alongside a fog-shrouded lake \u2013 inspired by classic horror films.
