It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.<br>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254950/extras/EN_2.png?t=1736766591\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2254950/extras/02.gif?t=1736766591\" /><br><br>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.<br><br>The Eternal Life of Goldman is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre's roots and took the most difficult path possible \u2013 meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques.

The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.<br><br>It's a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery \u2013 but it won't have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It's impossible to spend much time wandering around in The Eternal Life of Goldman without doing anything interesting.<br><br>Finally, it's a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story \u2013 but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension.
