This feature is perfect for consuming content, managing social media, or conducting quick searches while in the middle of a gaming session. Whether you\u2019re following a tutorial, watching a video, or browsing the web, OV allows you to do it all without ever leaving your game. You can also launch Notepad, Calculator, Spotify, or whatever you want on OV.<br><br><strong>Interactability</strong><br>OverlayView offers the ability to toggle the interactivity of the overlay.
