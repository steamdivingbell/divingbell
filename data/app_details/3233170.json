{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2> Pathfinder 2 RPG - Pathfinder Adventure Path #201: Pactbreaker (Wardens of Wildwood 1 of 3)<br> <br> Though they arrived as guests, the PCs are soon deputized as part-time guards for the annual Greenwood Gala, a convention for primal-tradition powerbrokers and a festival associated with the Green Faith. After entering competitions, making connections, and shutting down troublemakers, they earn a privileged seat at the ceremony renewing the Treaty of the Wildwood--a ceremony ruined when saboteurs assassinate several of the Verduran Forest's eminent leaders. This is the final insult many forest dwellers needed; as vigilantes and militias of arboreals, fey, and beasts mobilize to punish Andoran and Taldor, the PCs must avert bloodshed and maintain order long enough for the Wildwood Lodge to choose a new leader and restore peace. <br> <br> Pactbreaker is a wilderness-themed Pathfinder adventure for four 5th-level characters. The adventure begins the Wardens of Wildwood Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a group of adventurers navigate a tricky balance between idyllic wilderness, a hungry nation, and primal forces beyond the natural world. This volume also includes a look at the Verduran Forest, an ecology of the sentient treelike arboreals, several new magical items to discover, and new dangerous monsters to test your PCs!
