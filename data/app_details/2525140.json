Inspired by old school boomer shooters, GODWALKER aims to capture classic hardcore action packed arena shooter.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE FASTER YOU PLAY THE STRONGER YOU GET</h2>In GODWALKER the faster you play the stronger you get. Build up your GOD-METER as you collect the souls of hacked mythical enemies, and unleash a rage-fueled chaotic terror amongst them. The only language you speak is violence, and everyone needs a lesson. And you're a fluent native speaker. Of violence. You hurt good.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMPUTERS FROM HELL HAVE TAKEN OVER OLYMPUS</h2>You're an agent of chaos. The Pantheon has been hacked. With their blessings (and their cool guns) use your uncontrollable nature to sweep the floor against these gross electronic foes.<br>Discover more than 30 unique weapons as you battle through an ever changing arena. <br>Explore and discover dynamic combat arenas with maps that change as you play.<br>Fight against tons of enemies to annihilate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REPLAYABILITY</h2>GODWALKER is a roguelike shooter, this means that you start with nothing each run and build up your arsenal each time. Elements of play such as maps and weapons are randomized as you progress and replay. The game also features a run-prestige mode, where when you complete a run, you can begin another with all your gear with all damage doubled.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2525140/extras/giphy-downsized-large__1_.gif?t=1714578176\" /><br><br>Do you have what it takes to annihilate the computers and reclaim Olympus?<br>(spoilers: probably I mean it's a video game right?)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GUNS AND SHOOTING</h2>GODWALKER aims to build a classic experience with a few new tweaks. For example, weapons in this game can't be reloaded by hand. In order to reload them you must put them in your backpack, and you have unlimited ammo. This forces you to swap between weapons, creating an extremely hardcore dynamic combat scenario.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2525140/extras/giphy-downsized-large.gif?t=1714578176\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2525140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714578176","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2525140/page.bg.jpg?t=1714578176","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2525140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714578176","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2525140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714578176","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Features guns, combat, shooting others, shooting humanoids, and mostly cartoon violence.
