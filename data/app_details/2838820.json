{"about_the_game":"Enjoy a sneak peek of this brand-new dice game, where luck meets strategy as you face off against powerful friends. Remember, one good roll could change everything!<br><br>In this chaotic dice game, players battle by throwing their dice onto a board. But by hitting the other dice on the board you can change their values to your advantage, introducing an element of strategy on top of the luck present. Each die will defend or attack the corresponding player at the end of the dice-throwing phase. Battle until one or more players go down!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"/>{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/FudgyCharacters.GIF<br>In this limited demo, you'll be able to play as much Fudgy Dice as you want! However, you will need to wait for the full game to enjoy the entire cast along with all the dice that are up for grabs. For now, you can play as both Fudgy and Daisy in this short demo release.
