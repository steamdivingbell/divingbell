{"about_the_game":"Challenge your friends in this <strong>Local Multiplayer RPG Board Game hybrid</strong>. Choose a starting class that fits your playstyle and pick a map you want to fight on. Encounter lots of enemies, fight strong boss monsters, become stronger and collect gold to buy powerful dice and pieces of equipment to get the upper hand on your opponents. <br><br>Score <strong>Victory Points</strong> by the likes of leveling up or collecting more gold/gems than your opponents to win the game!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457780/extras/Fi-Knight_Classes.png?t=1693397129\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Before starting a game you can choose between 5 different classes. Each class has a different stat spread, a unique die and a unique starting equipment. Some classes are more difficult to use than others. These classes are as follows:</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>ADVENTURER</strong> - A beginner friendly class with average starting stats who has access to 2 more starting dice for a total of 4 dice. Use these dice to more accurately land on the spaces you desire to win. The adventurers special equipment gives you twice as many Victory Points for the gold you collected at the end of the game.<br></li><li><strong>BERSERKER</strong> - A PvP focused class with high a high ATK stat, use your special die to gain an ATK boost for a turn. Whenever you roll a 10 you gain access to an Conflict Orb which allows you to start a PvP battle against a random opponent. Use this class to hinder your opponents while staying ahead.<br></li><li><strong>PALADIN</strong> - This class focuses on defensive play with high DEF stat. Use your special die to heal your wounds each turn. Your Baneful Shield allows you to deal damage whenever an opponent tries to attack you. This class is perfect if you like to play it save and avoid dying.<br></li><li><strong>MONK</strong> - A somewhat weaker class stat wise but doesn't need as much EXP to level up. The unique Time Die allows this class to very accurately land on specific spaces, if you have the timing down. Use this class if you dislike random dice rolls.<br></li><li><strong>ZOMBIE</strong> - This unorthodox class has a very powerful die that allows for perfect accuracy plus an ATK and DEF boost, but can only roll 1,2 or 3. The equipment is very unusual, transforming battle spaces into zombie spaces whenever you win a battle on one.</li></ul><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457780/extras/Fi-Knight_Dice.png?t=1693397129\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You're able to obtain a lot of unique dice during the run of a game from enemy drops, shops or special board events. These dice can be very powerful ranging from having a useful range of numbers it can roll, special effects, specific stat boosts or bonus gold. Here are some examples of the dice you can obtain:</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>BOOST DIE</strong> - [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] A very useful die, acting as if you are throwing 2 dice at the same time. Because this die has a lot of possible numbers it does make it a bit less consistent compared to other dice. Use this if you really want to get to the other side of the map without caring about precision.<br></li><li><strong>KELP DIE</strong> - [1,11] A very useful die, this allows you to roll between 1 and 11 consistently. It's only obtainable from the enemy Seaweird and specific Dice Shops though, but it's very much worth it.<br></li><li><strong>FREEZE DIE</strong> - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] The first time you roll this die it will function as a standard die. After rolling a number for the first time it gets stored and you will be able to roll that number over and over again until you decide to use a different die for a turn and the number will reset.<br></li><li><strong>SHINING DIE</strong> - [5,6,7,8] The Shining Die is only available from the shining board event. It gives you a DEF boost based on your roll, which is between 5 and 8. This DEF boost can be extremely useful when battling specific monsters.<br></li><li><strong>GOLD DIE</strong> - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] This income die allows you to gain gold based on your roll. This is very useful if your win condition is gold, allowing you to gain an average of 5.5 gold each time you use this die.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457780/extras/Fi-Knight_Spaces.png?t=1693397129\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">There are multiple different spaces you can land on during the game, knowing what each of these does is key to win the game.

Start a random turn based battle to earn EXP &amp; either some gold, an item or a die.<br></li><li><strong>BAD LUCK SPACE (red)</strong> - Another common space. You will lose some gold when landed on here.<br></li><li><strong>EVENT SPACE (green)</strong> - A space unique to each map. This will trigger a specific board event that can be good, bad or neutral.<br></li><li><strong>SHOP SPACE (orange house)</strong> - An uncommon space. These spaces will allow you to buy items from a shopkeeper, but keep in mind you're only able to buy a single item per visit.<br></li><li><strong>WARP SPACE (purple)</strong> - A rare space. This will warp you to another warp space.<br></li><li><strong>LUCKY SPACE (silver/gold)</strong> - A very rare space. This space will give you a lot of gold.<br></li><li><strong>BOSS SPACE (dark red skull)</strong> - An uncommon space. These spaces will allow you to buy items from a shopkeeper, but keep in mind you're only able to buy a single item per visit.<br></li><li><strong>ZOMBIE SPACE (dark blue)</strong> - You will normally only encounter these when there is a player using the Zombie class. This will start a Zombie Battle.<br></li><li><strong>EXTRA TURN SPACE (yellow)</strong> - A space only available on the Desert Map. When landed on you'll get another turn.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2457780/extras/Fi-Knight_Victory_Points.png?t=1693397129\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">To win the game you need to acquire more victory points as your opponents, multiple factors determine your total victory points at the end of the game.
