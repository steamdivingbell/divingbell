{"about_the_game":"You're the lone survivor deep within the cursed lands. You need to explore and expand the world by unlocking the mysterious cells that surround you. You do this by gathering and making resources and selling them for more coins. Unlocking the surrounding world also cleanses them, bringing the world back to life the way it was before the unknown calamity struck -- a story that will be revealed through collecting hidden relics as you play.<br><br>As you unlock the world, you'll find fantastic underworld dungeons and caverns to explore, but while these can be rich with loot, they are also ripe with dangers like traps and creatures to fight. You'll need to craft the right gear to have any chance of returning from the depths.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2565530/extras/feature-c-1.gif?t=1695910477\" /></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2565530/extras/vex-new-1.gif?t=1695910477\" /><br>In Vexlands, unlocking each new space is like a pull on a slot machine.
