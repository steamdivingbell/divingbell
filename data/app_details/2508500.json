{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder RPG - Pathfinder Companion: Kobolds of Golarion<br> <br>  <br> Traps, Tribes, and Tenacity <br> Dwelling underground in the dark and twisting sprawl of their tunnels, kobolds make unlikely heroes.\u00a0Pathfinder Player Companion: Kobolds of Golarion\u00a0unlocks the potential of this cunning and skilled race, showing how the talents kobolds have trained in since birth--trapmaking, teamwork, and sneakiness--make them excellent dungeon delvers. Unlike some of the less intelligent creatures that share the Darklands with them, kobolds make allies among the surface races and exert influence in many of Golarion's cities. Though they're limited within their rigid tribal rules, kobolds have the ambition of dragons! <br> Many of the character options in this book can work for other types of characters who want to use traps or fight in the same style as kobolds. Others relate directly to the unique parts of kobold life, such as the significance of the way their scales mimic the hues of the chromatic dragons.
