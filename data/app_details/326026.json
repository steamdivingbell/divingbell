{"about_the_game":"British Railways decided that changes in the steel industry would require the use of more bogie vehicles, and as a consequence built a number of different designs.

This featured five fixed bolsters and lashing down rings on the solebar and the wagon was carried on LMS diamond frame bogies. The next 200 vehicles were to an LNER design, appearing in 1950, as Lot 2211 to Diagram 1/472 with the outer 2 bolsters moveable between 2 locations and lashing rings set into the floor of the wagon and were fitted with LNER diamond frame bogies.<br><br>1951 saw the appearance of Lot 2237 and with it, the change to GWR style plate bogies which set the appearance of the vast majority of Bolster D wagons with in excess of 1600 unfitted Diagram 1/472 vehicles constructed in 14 lots until 1958.
