{"about_the_game":"SCP-087-B UE Remake is a fan game based on the original SCP-087-B make by Joonas Rikkonen, a single-player horror experience from the point of view of a D-Class sent to explore what lurks below in the unexplored and undocumented depths of an ever-changing brick and concrete staircase. Equipped with only a lighter, the D-Class must navigate dozens of floors until they reach, or rather if they reach, the lowest level. <br><br>Much of the audio, graphics and monster design is loosely or directly based on the original design of SCP-087-B, with several more creatures and threats added in beyond the scope of the original.<br><br><br>Foundation Operatives grant all D-Class limited access to the associated documentation on this anomaly before entry, and recommends all subjects to brief themselves with the information before entry:<br><br><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-087-B<br><br><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid<br><br><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-087-B is located on the campus of [REDACTED].
