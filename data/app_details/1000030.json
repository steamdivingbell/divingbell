3?! takes the best of the first two games and brings so much more with better progression, more food, accessibility options, and more to be the ultimate cooking game. I already loved the first Cook, Serve, Delicious! game and while the second entry was a step forward in many ways, it also regressed. Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?! is everything I wanted from this franchise and more.\u201d<br>4.5/5 \u2013 Touch Arcade<br><br>\u201cCook Serve Delicious 3 is a stressful, yet at times relaxing, cooking game. It is so close to being perfect that I can't wait to see what the next iteration brings.\u201d<br>8/10 \u2013 PC Invasion<br><br>\u201cA relentless and strategic kitchen management game, Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?! rewards hard effort with moments of transcendental clarity, when plates start flowing and everything is slotting into place. It is meditation. I have never felt a greater sense of peace and purpose than when rolling six burritos in less than five seconds.
