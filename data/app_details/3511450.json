Along the way she meets up with a Seafarer named Kiara and the two traverse several ocean biomes, finding and catching new types of fish and other marine life along the way.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The land of Concordia, named after the Goddess Concordia, Mother of Sea and Star, is a vast series of small islands and land masses populated by humans, Seafarers, and various marine animals. The humans usually dwell more inland, while the non-human Seafarers make their settlements by the seashore. Seafarers have distinctive features such as long ears that help with sea navigation, and horns which act as beacons to communicate with the divines. Though similar in nature, Seafarers tend to stay away from human territories, much more preferring to stick as close to the sea as possible.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There is a darkness looming far beneath the sea referred to as &quot;The Deep&quot; by Seafarers. The Deep are a mutated, twisted, mangled race of Eldritch fish that rise from the abyss and cause havoc across the land. This abyssal power even can contaminate and corrupt regular marine life, turning them too, into abhorrent creatures. Every 500 years, a special person is chosen by the divines to become the Mystic Angler and uses the powers of the Oceanic Elements\u2013 Tide, Abyss, and Star\u2013 to cull the abyssal threat. However, it's been 502 years since the last Mystic and the land is once again falling to ruin without a new hero. Can Sakura and Kiara step up to the plate to rid the deep in place of the Mystic Angler?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3511450/extras/spacer.png?t=1740096479\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3511450/extras/fishing_mechanics.png?t=1740096479\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3511450/extras/QTE_desc.png?t=1740096479\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3511450/extras/mysfish_gif_final.gif?t=1740096479\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a fishable body of water, drop your line, and wait for a snag!
