{"about_the_game":"Embark on an immersive journey to build a prosperous settlement. Dive deep into a richly simulated economy where every decision shapes the destiny of your realm. Manage the land and its resources, workers\u2019 salaries, housing, taxes, and laws. Shape your settlement into either a capitalistic utopia or a communist haven<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Citizen</h2><br>Citizens are the heart of Farmman. Their professions dictate their roles in the economy, and their actions shape the kingdom. Assign them businesses to run or positions to work in, employ them and pay their salaries from the royal budget, loan them resources when needed, or request financial support during dire times<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2><br>As the king, you wield complete control over the economy. Empower your citizens to trade their resources and allow supply and demand to dictate prices, or take a more hands-on approach by setting all prices yourself. Implement taxes and provide subsidies to shape the economy. Determine the extent of personal ownership, deciding whether citizens can own houses, businesses, and resources, or if everything will be under the control of the royal family.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Living World</h2><br>Experience an in-depth simulation of a society where every participant, from animals to settlers, possesses a complex AI with emotions, needs, desires, goals, and relationships. Every action has a reaction, and even the smallest event can shatter the shape of the kingdom. Will you manage to keep the delicate balance, or will your kingdom crumble under the weight of its own intricacies?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive</h2><br>Survive in a world that shows no mercy. Your kingdom will face harsh winters, devastating famines, attacks from wild animals, and deadly pandemics. Only the strongest and most cunning rulers will endure these challenges and lead their people to prosperity. Will you rise to the challenge and create a thriving kingdom that stands the test of time? The fate of your civilization rests in your hands","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3127740/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728518867","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3127740/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728518867","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3127740/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728518867","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3127740/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728518867","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Embark on an immersive journey to build a prosperous settlement.
