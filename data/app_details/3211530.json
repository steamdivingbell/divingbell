They usually involve stealing, but can also include sabotage, spying, destroying evidence, and even babysitting. Some missions can be completed in different ways, which can affect the outcome.<br><br><strong>Unique Locations</strong><br>Apart from houses, apartments, and mansions, you'll also visit a supermarket, an office, a multi-level ship, a library, a multi-floor hotel, and a prison, just to name a few.<br><br><strong>Characters and Factions</strong><br>You'll meet lots of different characters, with very different styles, and they all have their own agenda.

Talk to a trainer to level up these skills to get a better success rate.<br><br><strong>Inventory Management</strong><br>A big part of the game is choosing what to steal. You can't carry it all. Do you look for specific items for a current mission? Or do you choose the items with the highest value? You don't know the value until you talk to the fencer, but you'll remember the range of values you've seen before for an item. Then you also have to think about weight and volume. Some things are heavier or take up more space. Do you choose to steal a few large valuable items or many small cheap items? Just watch out for cheap items that are large or heavy. The best is a small, valuable item. But you might not be able to sell those right away.<br><br><strong>Skills and Abilities</strong><br>As you gain experience, you'll level up and earn skill points. You can talk to a trainer to use those skill points to improve different skills. Prioritize the style that you like to play. Do you prefer kicking in doors or picking locks? Do you want to be fast or do you want to carry more?<br><br><strong>Change Characters</strong><br>The story will be the same, but you can change the way you look.<br><br><strong>Animals</strong><br>Quack! Ruff! Neigh! Mooooo! Cats and dogs move around on their own. Some might even follow you. Just watch out for skunks.<br><br><strong>Vehicles</strong><br>You can buy different vehicles to stash your stuff in while you're in the city, giving you more space to hold the things you steal! You start with a bicycle, but you can get a school bus, an ice cream truck, a postal van, a delivery van, and more.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3211530/extras/vehicles.gif?t=1727888651\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Attention to Details</h2><br>Some effort was put into polishing little details to make this game more fun and interesting.
