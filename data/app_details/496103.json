It shows you how well your PC handles ray tracing effects in real-time. Use Port Royal to benchmark graphics cards that support Microsoft DirectX Raytracing. Compare Port Royal benchmark scores to see how overclocking affects ray-tracing performance. Find your PC's performance limits with custom benchmark settings and detailed hardware monitoring charts.<br><br><br>3DMark Port Royal was developed with input from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and other leading technology companies. We worked especially closely with Microsoft to create a first-class implementation of the DirectX Raytracing API.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Port Royal Stress Test</h2>Check the reliability and stability of your system after buying or building a new PC, upgrading your graphics card or overclocking your GPU. Stress testing can also identify faulty hardware and a need for better cooling.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DirectX Raytracing feature test</h2>Measure the pure ray-tracing performance of your graphics card with the 3DMark DirectX Raytracing feature test. Instead of relying on traditional rendering, the whole scene is ray-traced and drawn in one pass. The result of the test depends entirely on ray-tracing performance. You can use this test to compare the performance of dedicated ray-tracing hardware in the latest graphics cards.<br><br><br>The test includes an interactive mode that lets you move freely around the scene and take screenshots. You can control the focus point and aperture of the camera to explore different depth of field effects using ray tracing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NVIDIA DLSS feature test</h2>This feature test was developed in partnership with NVIDIA.<br>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA RTX technology that uses the power of deep learning and AI to improve game performance while maintaining visual quality. This feature test helps you compare performance and image quality with and without DLSS.<br><br><br>With DLSS 2 and 3, you can select between three quality modes\u2014Quality, Performance and Ultra Performance\u2014and a range of resolutions, from Full HD up to 8K. With DLSS 3, DLSS Frame Generation uses AI to boost frame rates by generating additional high-quality frames, all while optimizing responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Intel XeSS feature test</h2>This feature test was developed in partnership with Intel.<br>XeSS (Xe Super Sampling) is an Intel graphics technology that uses AI-enhanced upscaling to improve performance while maintaining high image fidelity. XeSS renders each frame at a lower resolution to boost performance and then uses AI upscaling to generate frames at the target output resolution. <br><br><br>The 3DMark Intel XeSS feature test shows you how Intel XeSS affects performance. The 3DMark frame inspector tool helps you compare image quality with a side-by-side view of XeSS and native-resolution rendering.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496103/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1736850029","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496103/page.bg.jpg?t=1736850029","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496103/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1736850029","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496103/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1736850029","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This optional upgrade is only for people who bought 3DMark before January 8, 2019. <br>Copies of 3DMark purchased after that date come with the Port Royal Upgrade included.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/496103/extras/line-orange-1px.png?t=1736850029\" /><br><strong>To run these tests, you must have the Windows 10 October 2018 Update and a graphics card with drivers that support Microsoft DirectX Raytracing.
