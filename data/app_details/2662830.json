{"about_the_game":"In Caustic Bloom, you play as Ted, a new employee at \u201cSarcophagus II\u201d, an underground laboratory, dedicated to all sorts of interesting studies.  One afternoon, things take a turn for the worse when a gas fills the lab, causing everything it touches to grow and become violent.  You\u2019re able to escape to a biohazard quarantine chamber, but the windows of the chamber were not built to hold against what\u2019s waiting on the outside.  A struggle ensues, a transfiguration takes place, and Ted\u2019s world will never be the same.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Top-down Metroidvania</h2>Caustic Bloom combines the non-linear, ability-gated exploration with a top down perspective and combat for a fresh take on a beloved genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Health = Ammo</h2>You have just one resource to manage: Jelly.  As you fire off projectiles, you are firing of pieces of yourself.  When you destroy an enemy, they drop jelly blobs for you to collect.  As you collect more jelly, the larger you become.  The more jelly you fire off, the smaller you become.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Swap Colors</h2>As you progress through the game, you will gain new abilities for yourself.  One of the most notable being the color swap abilities, which can wildly change how your character plays, depending on what color you are currently in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Random Path Generation</h2>While the map stays the same, blocked paths and passageways abound and can change playthrough to playthrough.  You may find your way through the first time you play, only to find that door blocked by debris the next time through.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2662830?t=1711058658","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2662830?t=1711058658","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2662830/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1711058658","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2662830/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1711058658","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Captions available","id":13}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In Caustic Bloom, you play as Ted, a new employee at \u201cSarcophagus II\u201d, an underground laboratory, dedicated to all sorts of interesting studies.
