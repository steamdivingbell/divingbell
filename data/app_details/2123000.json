{"about_the_game":"&quot;Due to climate change, the Earth in 2027 has run out of energy resources. In Korea, batteries charged with a set amount of power are provided to all individuals, companies, and national organizations to guarantee the minimum right to live. War is taking place around the world to scramble for energy resources. We must protect the batteries in the military installations from intruders trying to take them away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're the commander of a military unit being invaded. Use battery power properly to protect the battery by preventing enemies from attacking 10 times in total.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you can see in the title, this game is a 2D defense game that was developed for 5 months inspired by Command and Conquer. In-game music, illustration, and scripting(Except for some sound effects) are all being developed by one person. The game that I used to make as a practice gradually developed and participated in the BIGS 2022(Korean indie game show), and as a result, it was released on Steam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game depicts the future of climate change. The time remaining before the increase in carbon emissions affects humanity has been set as a subtitle of the game, and the game is intended to remind gamers of the dangers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are still many bugs in the game and there are many shortcomings. We will continue to develop and update continuously even after the release. Please show a lot of interest. Thank you.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2123000?t=1669821419","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2123000/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1669821419","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2123000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1669821419","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2123000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1669821419","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Due to climate change, the Earth in 2027 has run out of energy resources.
