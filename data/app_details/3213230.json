Combined with the roguelite format it means that each run is not only <strong>unique mechanically</strong>, but also <strong>unique in its soundscape</strong>, allowing for twofold player expression in every choice made. Thematically, you play as a human musician battling hordes of strange aliens in various arenas, designed by the alien orchestrators as a gladiatorial spectator sport.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3213230/extras/Music.gif?t=1736006977\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3213230/extras/SurviveTT_1_.png?t=1736006977\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a run you will find yourself <strong>fighting the aliens</strong> to collect experience in order to <strong>level up your character</strong>.

Keep an eye out for care packages sent by adoring fans as they can give you just what you need in a given moment, but be careful to stay clear of their landing zone.
