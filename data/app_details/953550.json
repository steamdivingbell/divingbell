{"about_the_game":"Temple Scramble is a fast-paced, asymmetrical two-player game that pits keyboard against mouse. The player at the keyboard controls Indira, an adventurer exploring an ancient temple in search of valuable artifacts. She must run through the temple and collect five pieces of treasure, avoiding deadly traps along the way. The player at the mouse controls Phulax, a guardian spirit protecting the temple's treasure from would-be thieves. He must prevent Indira from leaving the temple with the treasure, by shifting around the floor she walks on, matching three tiles of the same color to create traps for her.<br><br>Test your wits in three different chambers of the Temple:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Bridge</strong> \u2013 If Indira doesn't watch her step, Phulax could whisk away the ground beneath her feet, sending her plummeting to the forest below!<br></li><li><strong>Courtyard</strong> \u2013 Huge spikes block Indira's path to the treasure.
