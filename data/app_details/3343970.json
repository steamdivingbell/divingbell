{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features experimental 2D simulated physics based gameplay. The main feature of the game is that every pixel, every object, every particle in the game is a simulated physical entity.  <br><br>This means, that the game is fair, it doesn't create invisible walls, doesn't impose unpredictable or illogical rules, doesn't script the way objects interact. What you see gives you complete idea what to expect. If you see a wall and want to go through, just shoot it and go. <br><br>Everything in the game is destructible. Everything acts accordingly to laws of physics, so if you want to do something, and your real world intuition makes you expect things to act in a certain way, chances are the game objects you interact with will work as you expect. <br><br>Therefore, the way you plan to win the level is up to you. You can explore possibilities, be creative, and you ideas will work if physics allow it. You can add matter, build shapes, create mechanical tools to reach the destination, you can destroy things. You can use forces, momentum or inertia. You can use ropes, wheels, jet engines, and so on. <br><br>Purely physically based gameplay is not very popular due to high performance requirements of physics simulation. But two years of prototyping and plenty of computer science allowed me to solve all problems and remove all technical obstacles, and now we have a robust physics engine, that works very fast, and allows to build massive sophisticated and fun to play with physical worlds. <br><br>The game will consists of many very different levels. You will drive a dirt bike, drive tanks and heavy multi purpose machines, fly in air, serf in water, dive underwater, fly in space, float in zero gravity or fight massive gravity, dig underground, build mechanical machines, attach jet engines and launch rockets, use ropes and forces, use heavy explosives and laser weapons. Simulated physics allow planty of ways to have fun.<br><br>But one of the most prominent features will be to control a soft body based character, that has evolved to walk and fight. That's a never before experienced level of realism and immersion.<br><br>The game is currently on early stage of implementing gameplay mechincs. The game will not be released in any kind of early access until it is finished and polished. But there will be multiple demos published, that would allow you to enjoy some of the physics based gameplay. <br><br>The game will include competitive levels with Steam based leaderboards, as well as casual levels. All levels will be highly replayable due to the fact, that it's hard to win one way, the physical world is chaotic in a certain way, and your actions will turn the world in different configurtations every time, opening new possibilities to beat levels. <br><br>The game will also have a tool for the players to create and publish user generated content.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343970/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734042590","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343970/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1734042590","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343970/6f66fb05e06e95ed84b5fbe91d38936b5ae90c82/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734042590","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3343970/6f66fb05e06e95ed84b5fbe91d38936b5ae90c82/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734042590","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game features experimental 2D simulated physics based gameplay.
