{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> D&amp;D Classics: The City of Greyhawk (2E)</h2>  Greyhawk - City of High Culture and Low Life!  From the darkest alleys and most fetid cellars of the Old City, along the alabaster spires of temple and university lining the great length of the Processional, and on to the regal grandeur of the High Quarter and the looming towers of the Grand Citadel beyond...  The city beckons. Greyhawk, grandest jewel of the Flanaess, awaits you, offering adventures to stagger your imagination, treasure beyond your wildest dreams--and, of course, dangers aplenty.  The city and its lands lie in the heart of civilized Oerth. The barren slopes of the mysterious Cairn Hills loom to the north of the city, within sight of the high walls. The placid expanse of the great river Selintan meanders past Greyhawk's bustling wharf region, giving the city its primary claim to strategic significance, for it lies along that waterway between the great lake of Nyr Dyv to the north and the broad surface of Woolly Bay and the Azure Sea to the south.  You get four full-size, full-color maps, each depicting a different aspect of the Greyhawk campaign. Detailed overview of the city and a closer look at its more influential citizens - and its more notorious criminals.  Many detailed, colorful adventure cards provide players with short adventures in the city and throughout the surrounding realms of Greyhawk. &quot;","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3490490?t=1739891954","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3490490?t=1739891954","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3490490/d1fdbad56babae9683d364e199a0e4e4908c617c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1739891954","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3490490/d1fdbad56babae9683d364e199a0e4e4908c617c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1739891954","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> D&amp;D Classics: The City of Greyhawk (2E)</h2>  Greyhawk - City of High Culture and Low Life!
