{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hello!</h2><br>Hot Dog Reporter is a (very early access) game about a hot dog in a hurry.<br><br>It's a fast paced platformer with a speedrun mode that will eventually turn into a metroidvania with a mystery to solve and charmingly weird characters to meet (and a speedrun mode). Once the linear levels are iterated on enough to finalize Hot Dog Reporter's mechanics, gameplay will begin to spill onto the sprawling, interconnected streets of New Yorkshire City. I already have a pretty firm grasp of the final narrative shape and visual direction, and I can't wait to share what's inside my head (and also inside like 500 word documents and photoshop files).
