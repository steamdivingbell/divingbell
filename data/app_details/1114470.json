One day, a letter signed by him is received, claiming he\u2019s on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Nobody knows why, but he asked specifically for a girl named \u201cDysis\u201d to go and look for him. The player will take control of this girl, who we don\u2019t know much about. As we follow Dysis\u2019s adventure, questions will start to be answered little by little. All of the little puzzle pieces which seemed unrelated in the beginning will now begin to slowly fit together as the truth is slowly revealed.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1114470/extras/ezgif-2-b207316addef_STEAM.gif?t=1584492470\" />","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1114470?t=1584492470","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1114470?t=1584492470","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1114470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1584492470","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1114470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1584492470","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Evan's Remains is a mystery-thriller puzzle adventure about finding a missing boy: Evan.
