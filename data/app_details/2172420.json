{"about_the_game":"Welcome to Belorov. <br><br>You stay the night in a walled town with your travelling companion. Terrible affairs of the past leave you two lost, left with no choice. <br>The master of the town has invited you and three others to partake in a banquet on All Hallows' Eve. But as the moon wanes, the scent of fresh blood can be smelled as a scream punctures the night. <br>Your companion has been accused of murder: after all, he's beginning to take on a monstrous form, and the easiest option would be to blame him. The curse brings with it deceit. <br>Can you prove his innocence to these strangers? <br>You have until sundown. <br><br>Wolfskin's Curse is a fully voice-acted, kinetic (linear with no choices) story.
