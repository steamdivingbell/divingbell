{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <strong> Background story </strong> </h2>In 1942, the brutal actions of Japanese fascism became increasingly rampant on the Pacific battlefield. They slaughtered civilians, abused prisoners of war, and forced soldiers to carry out kamikaze attacks, causing unprecedented levels of terror on the battlefield. In this extreme situation, you are summoned to go on a mission to end all these atrocities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <strong> Game Features </strong> </h2><strong> Rich weapon system </strong><br>You can sing a march with a big knife while lifting it and chopping at the devil's head. In addition to the classic WWII 38 Mauser pistol, Thompson submachine gun, Mosengan and other firearms. You can also set fire and electrocute devils. If you feel that these are not enough, we still have a nuclear bomb that can destroy the sky and earth for you to use.<br><strong> A brand new driving combat experience </strong><br>Everyone has driven enough tanks and armored vehicles, it's time for a different driving and combat experience. When making this battle jeep, I found it very difficult to find a similar game. So the driving combat system in this game will be a very novel combat experience. In addition to being able to drive this Jeep, there are also levels for flying airplanes for aerial combat and bombing.<br><strong> Reproduction of classic historical events </strong><br>It is a pity that few games have been made on the Eastern Front of World War II, especially many classic historical events that have not been made into games. In the game, you will participate in many real events that have influenced history. For example, Yamamoto Isoroku, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, participated in Li Mei's bombing mission of Tokyo and carried napalm bombs to ignite the entire city. Finally, in a brilliant radiance, bringing peace to the entire world.<br><br><strong> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Level Introduction </h2> </strong><br><strong> Guadao Sunset: </strong><br>You are on Guadalcanal Island in 1942, and as a Marine, your mission is to carve out a bloody path to support friendly positions. As night falls, the Japanese army will launch a crazy suicide attack, and you must hold your ground until dawn.<br><br><strong> Battle of Solomon Islands: </strong><br>Solomon Island in 1944 became your next battlefield. You will drive a modified Jeep and conduct landing operations with the Allies. However, not only do you have to face the stubborn resistance of the Japanese army, but you also have to constantly guard against suicide attacks by the kamikaze special forces.<br><br><strong> Hunting Yamamoto Isoroku: </strong><br>Our intelligence personnel have deciphered the Japanese code and learned that the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Isoroku Yamamoto, will be conducting an inspection on the front line on April 18th aboard a medium bomber, escorted by six fighter jets. President Roosevelt personally made the decision to intercept Yamamoto!<br><br><strong> Tokyo Hot: </strong><br>With the success of the island hopping tactic, we have approached the enemy's stronghold and it is time to deliver a fatal blow to their hearts. Under the leadership of General Li Mei, you will fly B-29 Superfortress bombers to bomb the city of Tokyo. Dropping incendiary bombs in densely populated urban areas, countless civilians were engulfed in flames, like a purgatory on earth.<br><br><strong> Battle of Iwo Jima: </strong><br>You participated in the siege of Iwo Jima in 1945, driving tanks towards the Japanese defense line. However, you found that the Japanese not only treated the enemy cruelly and ruthlessly, but also tied their soldiers to the position with iron chains, forcing them to live or die together with the position. In this situation, you must calmly respond, destroy the enemy's defensive fortifications, and ultimately achieve victory.<br><br><strong> The End of the Giant Beast: </strong><br>The giant beast let out a deafening roar, its naval guns roared and flames soared into the sky, attempting to defeat all challenges with its own strength. However, the gears of fate have already turned, and the end of the giant beast is predetermined. In a loud bang, the hull of the Yamato split open, and flames engulfed its body. It eventually sank into the deep sea along with the wolfish ambitions of Japanese fascism.<br><br><strong> Okinawa Island Rescue: </strong><br>In Okinawa Island in 1945, your mission was to rescue villagers who were taken away by the Japanese army. After a fierce battle, you discovered a terrifying scene.<br><br><strong> Radiant Radiance: </strong><br>The final task has arrived. As a member of the US Air Force, you will undertake the task of dropping nuclear bombs on the mainland of Japan. In this final action, there are no enemies, only your confrontation with fate. When you fly towards the designated target and drop the devastating nuclear bomb, you realize that this decision will take countless lives. But this is also the only way to end the war and save more lives. The explosion of a nuclear bomb shines like the sun, casting a dazzling light over the city, bringing death and destruction, and also bringing the dawn of peace to the world.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728106661","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009980/page.bg.jpg?t=1728106661","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009980/d6980794d4fe80befb21cb16ccee4eae83842f2d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728106661","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009980/d6980794d4fe80befb21cb16ccee4eae83842f2d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728106661","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <strong> Background story </strong> </h2>In 1942, the brutal actions of Japanese fascism became increasingly rampant on the Pacific battlefield.
