For thousands of years, Nanook received sacrifices from humans and offerings like weapon, hunting tools and maybe the most important, knowledge. Learning from observing humans, Nanook now can steal and use the technology created by this new type of life: the robots.<br><br>Since the A.I. were too preoccupied and focused on how to exterminate the human race, they never stopped to pay attention to other supernatural beings that could exist. With the human race now extinct, it is now the time for the robots to focus on gathering resources and becoming a better civilization that humans only dreamed for. However, for the machine big surprise, they did not anticipate the problem that Nanook could pose to all that they achieved after exterminating all humans.
