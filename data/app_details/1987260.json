As a personal indie studio, the development team aims to keep updating and improving the game while avoiding insular development.

Game Type:<br />\r\nThis is a sandbox roguelike cultivation game where you recruit and train talents, collect materials, refine pills and weapons, and explore dungeons. The combat is side-scrolling with multiple characters, where players can arrange the order of martial arts skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC. Game Worldview:<br />\r\nThe game integrates the ancient Chinese mythological geography book &quot;The Classic of Moutains and Rivers&quot;,  with mainstream monsters and deities from around the world, categorized into nine types: beasts,ghosts, demons, deities, fairies, immortals etc. Players can choose any race to start their cultivation journey, with a Nine-Tailed Fox spirit reincarnated in their body, providing protection and the ability to escape when battles are tough. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nD. Game Mechanics:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.Random Generation: Maps, dungeons, characters, and equipment attributes are all randomly generated.<br />\r\n2.Casual Combat: Characters fight automatically, and players can decide the selection and order of martial arts skills based on the opponent's moves. There are over 200 skills.<br />\r\n3.Talent Selection and Training: Different races have different upgrade methods, combat characteristics, and talent caps.<br />\r\n4.Home Building: Players have a sect where they can refine weapons and pills, grow plants, read, and chat with recruited companions.<br />\r\n5.Destructible Maps: Trees and rocks on the exploration maps can be destroyed as the player levels up.<br />\r\n6.Dungeon Adventures: Dungeons offer treasure hunting, random events, talents, ancient bosses, and more. New content will be added gradually.<br />\r\n7.Nine Tails: Each tail has different skills and serves as a save file. Defeating other tails' bosses allows you to acquire their skills.<br />\r\n8.MOD Support: The game allows easy modification of skills, materials, bosses, dialogue, and more. These are stored as CSV and TXT files in the game directory under StreamingAssets\\Language and can be edited with a text editor. The game will automatically read these files. Dialogue files can also be added according to naming rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game data is quite complex, and players are encouraged to adjust and test it to create their own Nine-Tailed Fox. Players interested in contributing ideas are welcome to join the discussion on steam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE. Art Style:<br />\r\nSince the game features monsters from both Eastern and Western cultures, the art style is a blend of both rather than purely one or the other. The style may still be maturing, and many character images are rough. The full version will be more refined. After a year and a half of development, AI assistance was incorporated, but the artistic style is already established.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nF. Mature Content Notice:<br />\r\nThe game may contain very simple seductive and offspring-related dialogue. Some monster and demon characters may have certain female or human features. Some human equipment, such as bikinis, may be somewhat revealing, and some Nine-Tailed Fox characters may be designed to be sensual. The game does not and will not include coercive behavior, drug, or alcohol abuse.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_NAME_1_0","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1987260/ee8841112baedf633a84bc2dcadc6f5122df2ecf.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987260/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726654815","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987260/page.bg.jpg?t=1726654815","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726654815","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1987260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726654815","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":"The game may contains some extremely simple dialogues for seduction and procreation.
