{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  ESCAPE WRAITH RIDGE ASYLUM </h2>  <strong>  A Level 0 Gauntlet or Level 1 Adventure <br>   <br>  By David Cole - Bardic Mischief </strong>  <br>  The adventurers awaken to the clink of heavy iron chains and the muffled sobs of the hopeless. Their bodies ache as they lie on stained cots in a vast, dimly lit hospital ward, the air heavy with the stench of antiseptic and despair. They realize with growing horror that they, along with dozens of other captives, have been shanghaied and sold to this sinister island facility. The asylum's staff, clad in bloodstained lab coats, lurk in the shadows, speaking in hushed tones about their grotesque craft. Here, Genomancy--a forbidden blend of alchemy, biology, and dark magic--is practiced with unholy zeal, twisting the very fabric of humanity. The captives are no longer people but raw material for the creation of &quot;Genomorphs,&quot; beings born of cruelty and arcane experimentation. <br> <br>  Escape Wraith Ridge Asylum <br>  is a gothic horror-themed adventure that challenges players to escape floor by floor. Each level presents a unique condition or objective that must be met before the characters can advance. The adventure is filled with nods to classic horror tropes, offering players a sense of familiarity amidst the terror. Inspired in part by H.G. Wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau, the narrative also introduces numerous NPCs who inject moments of humor, balancing the darker aspects of the horror experience. <br> <br>  This adventure features 14 beautiful maps, 24 new spells, 26 pre-generated level 0 playable characters, 26 new monsters and adversaries, and a new Necromancer Character Class  &quot;The Bloodletter&quot;. <br> <br>   Maps created using Dungeondraft.
