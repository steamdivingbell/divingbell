In short, they did well.

Her Interactive has done an excellent job with this series in providing challenging adventures which are fun and engaging, and which are culturally relevant to today\u2019s teen, without resorting to the programming laziness of cheap sex and extreme violence. The Haunted Carousel is a great game to get for kids ages 12-16 (and older and younger, too).\u201d<br>PC GameZone<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_8d1e0115107346c62d3a5fbe90be346892ab51b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_8d1e0115107346c62d3a5fbe90be346892ab51b3.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_4cd0f09149bd6a5ecd63c4e5997af9b40f70186d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_4cd0f09149bd6a5ecd63c4e5997af9b40f70186d.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_68ef466b890c74d4b392cf03c7e0fba43cd94042.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_68ef466b890c74d4b392cf03c7e0fba43cd94042.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_31bd52da92b912895fd124b12898112017d9b711.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_31bd52da92b912895fd124b12898112017d9b711.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_12b88d4066755b17cad099e3406ff0fca02dbd80.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_12b88d4066755b17cad099e3406ff0fca02dbd80.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_b95e08bb29ea3520aeb2c5cd0c8e2f679b0c6d37.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_b95e08bb29ea3520aeb2c5cd0c8e2f679b0c6d37.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_de097ac352fef4899c23155589e0772cc3bcb096.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_de097ac352fef4899c23155589e0772cc3bcb096.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_6de3057a6bda5596c3d4982e63307d86d1b24c06.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_6de3057a6bda5596c3d4982e63307d86d1b24c06.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":8,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_cb067264966473ad812b8d354efc89f8981cfc80.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_cb067264966473ad812b8d354efc89f8981cfc80.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":9,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_49274adbad5f3f5831978c91933bb7d582731bb2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_49274adbad5f3f5831978c91933bb7d582731bb2.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":10,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_7c3b69a2324b6a791fc9e794724975da3b8ed87a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_7c3b69a2324b6a791fc9e794724975da3b8ed87a.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":11,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_fe641d9646757bc536ca07c528cfc1d3a7797363.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_fe641d9646757bc536ca07c528cfc1d3a7797363.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"},{"id":12,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_ff7e9032b15184fa3009b4ccdbb3f9949c6cbb4a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734466086","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/31820/ss_ff7e9032b15184fa3009b4ccdbb3f9949c6cbb4a.600x338.jpg?t=1734466086"}],"short_description":"Take a Spin with Danger to Unravel the Mystery of a Ghostly Merry-go-Round!","steam_appid":31820,"support_info":{"email":"techsupport@herinteractive.com","url":"https://www.herinteractive.com/support/contact-support/"},"supported_languages":"English","type":"game","website":"https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/nancy-drew-the-haunted-carousel/"}
