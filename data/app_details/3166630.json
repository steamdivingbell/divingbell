{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166630/extras/30mb-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1737371876\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lead the first Mars colonists as Chief Commander. Build and manage your base, pick and recruit your people, cultivate farms, expand your base and research advanced technologies to defend against swarms of bugs. Can you lead your people and family to survive and prosper in the face of what Mars throws at you?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BUILD YOUR COLONY</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Begin building your colony by crafting for resources. From houses, farms, and research labs to building heavy-duty mechs, every build is one step closer to creating your Mars civilization. With resource management and strategic planning, your colony can withstand any weather or creature.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FARM YOUR FUTURE</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embrace the freedom of farming on this red terrain by cultivating crops to feed your colonists, boosting their happiness and productivity. Surplus crops can be sold to Earth for money and then used to invest in your skill tree. Optimize your agricultural setup from simple crop cultivation to automated farming systems. Remember to diversify your crop range! Colonists can only eat corn for so long.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DEFEND AGAINST BUGS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Defend and protect your colony from swarms of bugs that are hungry for fresh newcomers. Strategically place turrets and mechs around your base to maximize their effectiveness, and utilize the skill tree to upgrade your high-tech factories. Soon, your automated systems will fend off incoming threats while everyone grabs a cup of coffee for a job well done.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MANAGE YOUR RESOURCES</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With great resources comes great resource management! As Chief Commander, send orders allocating resources, upgrading infrastructure, and defending the base against incoming threats. Every decision will determine whether your colony becomes an innovation hub or mayhem. Embrace the challenge, have some fun, and show Mars what true leadership looks like!</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>RESEARCH AND INNOVATE</strong> </h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Advance your colony\u2019s capabilities by researching technologies from the Tech Tree. From improved farming techniques, advanced mech and turret defense systems to enhanced automation, each technological breakthrough opens new possibilities for your colony\u2019s expansion on Mars. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>EXPAND AND CONQUER</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As your base and colonists thrive, explore further into the great unknown, where you just might discover rare minerals that will propel your colony into a bustling city. Venture into the challenging terrains of Mars, from dry deserts to icy polar regions, creating new bases like a black-market trading center along the way. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>LAND ON MARS</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Mars began as a passion project of four people, and we\u2019re committed to continuously improving the game with demos and feedback from you. Join us on our Steam Community and social media to stay updated on this journey as we build Mars. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166630/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737371876","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166630/page.bg.jpg?t=1737371876","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166630/cbe80ff06f4caaa36af9ed5d439e7637e6088e51/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737371876","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166630/cbe80ff06f4caaa36af9ed5d439e7637e6088e51/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737371876","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166630/extras/30mb-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?t=1737371876\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lead the first Mars colonists as Chief Commander.
