Oh yeah, I've heard that too. But there are all sorts of wild theories floating around. Some say we\u2019ll be reborn based on how we lived before, part of some endless cycle. Others are convinced this is Valhalla, where we wait for Ragnarok, the final battle. Some think we\u2019re here to be judged, either sent to paradise or punishment. Then there are those who say the way you died determines your fate, and depending on it you need to climb the levels of the underworld. This would be a problem for me, I don't even remeber how I died!<br>How about you? Maybe you should explore a bit before jumping to any conclusions.<br><br><strong>Coming soon!</strong><br>The game is still in development, but is all steam ahead so it can be launched as soon as possible!
