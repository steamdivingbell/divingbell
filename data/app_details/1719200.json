{"about_the_game":"Help Mark find his way through dark scary caves, vast woodlands, a forgotten desert, while fighting off the native creatures of Tar Alterra. During your adventure you inadvertently start the end of the world. Hours of fun, fighting, questing, or just throw Mark off a mountain and watch him tumble. Did I mention the demons? All our fates lie in our ordinary everyday dude who really was just out looking for his dog, Spike. Your choice is simple.  Live out your days fighting for survival in Tar Alterra, or searching the forgotten desert to locate the lost artifact that hold the key to your return. Good luck, and bring Mark home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis overall hack and slash brought to you from Tonkan Veed Games. Tar Alterra vol. 1 now available.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1719200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1647374607","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1719200/page.bg.jpg?t=1647374607","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1719200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1647374607","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1719200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1647374607","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Help Mark find his way through dark scary caves, vast woodlands, a forgotten desert, while fighting off the native creatures of Tar Alterra.
