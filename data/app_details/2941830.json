{"about_the_game":"Tyga is a single-player horror delivery game. It's your job to help Tyga deliver lifesaving medicine to those who can afford it. You will enter your delivery vehicle and depart from their warehouse to make periodic stops at every home on your route. Make sure to check the security cameras before you exit the vehicle just to be safe! If its ever too dark to see you can use the lights that come with your vehicle to check for any irregularities outside of your vehicle. After you reach the end of the route, you will repeat it all again the next day until payday! It tends to get more dangerous and hectic as the week goes on so be sure to deliver with caution... With enough hard work, someday it could be you receiving packages from them! See you on the road, Tygan!<br><br>Welcome to Tyga! As an employee and resident of Tyga Estate 36-B, it is your job to deliver Bacteriophages to our insured customers. The road can be perilous, which is why we've equipped our employees with the means of self-preservation and Phage protection. Utilize your Bohr Model \u00c6, a top-of-the-line vehicle generously supplied by Tyga, to maintain a steady course through your pre-planned route.<br><br>Thanks to our partnership with Orange Inc, your taxes go towards supplying every Bohr with a Cam-Puter 15 Ultimate Pro Max (basic chipset). With their revolutionary technology, you have a full 360-degree view of your Bohr's exterior. That's right, nothing gets in or out without Tyga knowing about it.
