{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is an independent horror puzzle game developed by me. It uses a first-person perspective and combines rules and strange stories to solve puzzles and explore, ensuring survival while finding the final truth.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game currently only supports keyboard operation, WASD movement, and the mouse is used for interaction and perspective conversion. Long press the middle mouse button to zoom in and focus. Left shift runs, left ctrl crouches, and there are 3 number keys available above: 1. Weapons 2. Lighting 3. Photographing. ESC opens system settings.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This version is a demo trial version and does not represent the final quality of the game. The game content is a small part of the first part of the overall content, and includes a small part of the puzzle content of the first scene (teaching level) and the second scene (lounge level) of the game. The demo experience content is about 1/5 of the overall content of the game. Since the entire game is a linear narrative, the content of the demo version tends to be teaching and familiar with the environment, and the content later will be relatively exciting.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730897540","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730897540","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179470/04daf6f10c96a849f9c9dd6a2af4044380f59dcb/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730897540","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3179470/04daf6f10c96a849f9c9dd6a2af4044380f59dcb/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730897540","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Some scenes contain violence, blood, rotting corpses, etc., as well as a certain amount of thriller and horror shots."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is an independent horror puzzle game developed by me.
