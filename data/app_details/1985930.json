Crouch and stay low, so enemies won't hear you.<br>2. Hide under tables, furniture, lockers or crawl spaces and stay safe. <br>3. Don't run or you will make noise. Run only when necessary. <br>4. Be careful when walking on glass and rubbish - since it makes noise. <br>5. You can cause a distraction by throwing objects around.<br>6. Mind your stamina, if you get tired then you cannot outrun it.<br>7. Search every corner for medicine, just in case you get injured.<br>8. Use your spray-gun and mark location that you already been too, so you don't get lost.<br>9. If you hear running foosteps, that's not good news - as it may have heard you. Run or hide!<br>10. <br><br>The Backrooms: 1998 is a horror game made by one developer at Steelkrill Studio. Please note this game is an objective-collection game with a story.
