Even if the design of some of the gameplay is somewhat straightforward, compared to some works that use the setting as a gimmick but the actual content is empty and boring, &quot;Babel&quot; obviously handles both the &quot;storytelling&quot; and &quot;puzzle solving&quot; parts very well. If you love traditional word adventure games with reasoning and multi-line narration, then &quot;A Guidebook Of Babel&quot; is definitely worth watching.\u201d<br>8.2 \u2013 Gamersky<br><br>\u201c\u5c06\u300a\u5df4\u522b\u53f7\u6f2b\u6e38\u6307\u5357\u300b\u79f0\u4f5c\u300c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u89e3\u8c1c\u5192\u9669\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6807\u6746\u300d\u7edd\u975e\u5938\u5927\u5176\u8bcd\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73a9\u5230\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u786e\u5b9e\u6ca1\u6709\u60f3\u5230\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u6b3e\u5c0f\u4f53\u91cf\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6e38\u620f\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5448\u73b0\u72ec\u7279\u7f8e\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u4e25\u5bc6\u800c\u53c8\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u5267\u672c\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u5145\u6c9b\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u7acb\u4f53\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5f62\u8c61\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u201d<br>9 \u2013 IGN CN<br><br>\u201cThese things that evoke the desire to explore make me always motivated to rush to the next scene and see how the story develops.
