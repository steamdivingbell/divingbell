{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The story</h2>In Resonance you experience the story of the space pilot Robert Wallace and the neuroscientist Catriona Bruce. Through a chain of circumstances, these divorced spouses are chosen to explore the space station DIOMHAIR 16 in the year 2301, to which all radio contact has been lost. However, their landing is anything but smooth and so the two are confronted with bigger problems than their unprocessed separation. Terrible things have happened on board and soon it is not only survivors but also a way off the station to find. In the process, the characters not only learn the dark secrets that led to the disaster on the DIOMHAIR 16, but also get caught up in supernatural events, the resonances. In the process, they delve into their own pasts and relive formative moments of their lives together. The fate of the two and that of the entire space station is in your hands.
