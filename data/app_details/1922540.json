{"about_the_game":"This game is the passion project of a 16-year-old game dev who designed, programmed, and developed this game solo. Any support you give is greatly appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Reflection is a game that offers a brand new view on space and matter. The game explores the connection to an alternate dimension called The Reflection that contains all the matter of the world inverted. The portal to this dimension is characterized by a plane of water. From the surface, there appears to be simply a reflection of light, but submerging into the water reveals that this dimension is completely tangible, mirroring the world perfectly. Even moving objects and enemies are reflected, allowing players to interact with them from another angle (literally).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery aspect of the gameplay is carefully designed to utilize and expand the possibilities of The Reflection. Portals throughout the world enable the player to travel from a surface in The Reflection to its corresponding surface (now a ceiling) in the world. Some enemies exist in The Reflection and appear upside down in the world. Underwater sections of moving platforms disappear completely when reflected.
