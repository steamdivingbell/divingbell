Be the devil that tempts him or the disciple that betrays him, as you walk the thin line between the dark and the light. Unlock the mysteries of creation and use up to 24 different powers for good or evil, in an action-packed world where the struggle to survive tests your faith. <br><br>Upon playing through the game once, you can start again with a character of your own creation at any point in the story - and save your changes to all other characters to make the world your own!
