{"about_the_game":"&quot;People Jumping Tower&quot; is a casual-indie game that tests the player's athletic abilities and challenges them to beat their own records. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, the player takes on the role of an athlete who is determined to jump higher and higher. However, as some fences are too high for him to jump on his own, he enlists the help of his friends to assist him. <br />\r\nThe game features a tower with multiple levels, each level presenting a different height for the athlete to jump. The athlete will need to time their jump perfectly to clear each fence and reach the next level. As the athlete progresses through the game, the heights of the fences will increase, making the jumps more challenging.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe athlete's friends will stand at the base of the tower and lift the athlete up, allowing him to jump to even greater heights.<br />\r\nOverall, &quot;People Jumping Tower&quot; is a fun and challenging game that tests the player's timing and jumping skills.
