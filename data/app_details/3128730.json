{"about_the_game":"Colorsweeper is a unique and addictive color puzzle game that combines Minesweeper and Nonograms.<br>Like Minesweeper, the player's goal is to fill in all the blanks with the correct color, using the information given on the eight adjacent squares.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diverse play experience</h2><br>In addition to the basic rules described above, players can choose from a variety of modes to try out over 15,000 combinations. <br>Whether it's making numbers invisible on certain squares, or using two or four colors, Colorsweeper's various modes allow players to have a very different playing experience from the traditional rules.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infinite play experiences</h2><br>The self-generating algorithm also allows for an infinite number of additional puzzles to be created and played beyond the nearly 200 stages that come with the game. <br>Players can add their own modes to customize the puzzles to their preferences, or find something new to do with the Daily Challenge, which randomly selects a mode each day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Guaranteed Solution</h2><br>We have a generation/verification algorithm that ensures that a solution to a puzzle must exist, eliminating any negative experiences due to randomness during play. <br>Every puzzle in Colorsweeper can be solved from start to finish using only deduction.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728555034","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728555034","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728555034","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3128730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728555034","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":3270460,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Colorsweeper
