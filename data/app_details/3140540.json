{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dive into the dark depths of an abandoned hospital in The Silence, a thrilling single-player horror game. Alone and abandoned, you awaken in a gloomy corridor, surrounded by crumbling walls and an oppressive feeling of isolation. But the silence is deceptive because you are never truly alone. A sinister presence stalks you, watching your every move from the shadows.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In this intense but short horror game you will constantly feel uneasy and threatened. The darkness is omnipresent, the corridors are labyrinthine, and every room holds new horrors. The echo of your footsteps and the creature scratching on the cold ground are the only sounds that break the oppressive silence. Your heartbeat becomes the only beat that tells you that you are still alive - at least for now.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The atmosphere of &quot;The Silence&quot; is designed to push you to your psychological limits. The game creates a deep sense of unease as you frantically search for a way out. Your senses are overwhelmed and your fears are increased immeasurably. Every second in this hospital is a test of your nerves and sanity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3140540/extras/SteamFeatures.png?t=1727014431\" /></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">PERMANENT DEATH</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MULTIPLE ENDINGS</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">REALISTIC GRAPHICS</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">JUMPSCARES</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">CREEPY ATMOSPHERE</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">HIDING SYSTEM</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">STORY</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">MONSTER AI </p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3140540/extras/The_Silence_GIF.gif?t=1727014431\" /></p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Pretty Dark","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/496295ed17abb349b207f401a64442b986b070b1.jpg"},{"name":"Good Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/2b714a7f27fb2cbbb53a33c137498d2205f5c5ea.jpg"},{"name":"Bad Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/bf385f17d5e2436f6cc909bc74967643562b13f7.jpg"},{"name":"Dementia","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/0a242ae86635e89cce6fea39e518e5590b699203.jpg"},{"name":"Short Break","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/a4e3a4a4dc4768a272b474cd25b4f68b96f0a792.jpg"},{"name":"Thirsty","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/441e32501f05482bf5b8b98bb4f8074d874669e4.jpg"},{"name":"Bookworm","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/e63fd092a52cf34458e76a1ef099e49d42de5827.jpg"},{"name":"Hard Mode","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3140540/5e8ac66ce18297612f00dbc342075277a7bb8ec4.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3140540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1727014431","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3140540/page.bg.jpg?t=1727014431","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3140540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1727014431","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3140540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1727014431","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dive into the dark depths of an abandoned hospital in The Silence, a thrilling single-player horror game.
