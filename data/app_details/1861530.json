{"about_the_game":"An immersive, first-person action game set in an abandoned mining town on the outskirts of a Utopian city in the near-future. You are tasked to find and eliminate 'failed experiments' which are polluting the area. Uncover new abilities to use on the world and in combat, discover the reason for the lands desertion, and battle against formidable bosses as the world around you continues to decay. Maybe you'll discover why, or maybe you'll push on to complete the mission assigned to you. The path you walk is yours to choose.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Impactful Combat</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/extras/hit_with_rock.gif?t=1683249255\" /><br>It's important to me that every hit (both against you and from you) has a sense of weight to it. Sometimes the effect will be subtle, and sometimes the effect will be brutal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player Agency</h2>I have no narrative ambitions that overwrite your impact as a player. The story, as minimal as it is, will be dictated by your actions. The game world itself, too, will be affected by your actions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Immersive First-Person Movement</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/extras/movement.gif?t=1683249255\" /><br>There's still work to be done, but it's a deliberate goal of mine to make the character feel like a living being, rather than a floating camera.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Non-Linear Progression</h2>Although there will only be a handful of bosses, you are free to approach them in any way you see fit. As you chose your own path, the rest of the world will change. You'll also have the opportunity to acquire your abilities in a unique order.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Systemic Mechanics</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/extras/Pulling_MK.gif?t=1683249255\" /><br>The player will have a multitude of abilities which can be used in tandem on various objects: from barrels, to bosses, to the player itself.

To achieve this aim, I've worked diligently from the outset to craft a game system for machine learning AI. The bosses you face have the ability to assess any sort of action (whether from you, a plant, or a barrel) and the ability to remember any of these actions. If you're curious about how exactly this all works, I have a break down on YouTube about it, but the important takeaway is that this system allows for complex AI behavior. For me, complexity has been essential for crafting believable and engaging boss fights.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Utilitarian Art Style</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/extras/GIF_-_Trees.gif?t=1683249255\" /><br>The art style serves a mechanical purpose. I've deliberately chosen shading/texturing techniques for certain types of objects to help the player parse information with a quick glance. I don't expect this to be front and center in your mind, but I hope it helps subliminally.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Death is Your Last Resort</h2>I want to change the trope of dying and restarting. When you fail, the game will take a different course rather than rolling you back in time. It's possible to fail repeatedly and die, but losing one fight will not end your story. You will have the opportunity to rise up and face the challenge again, albeit in a new context.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1683249255","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/page.bg.jpg?t=1683249255","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1683249255","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1861530/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1683249255","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1999690,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"An immersive, first-person action game set in an abandoned mining town on the outskirts of a Utopian city in the near-future.
