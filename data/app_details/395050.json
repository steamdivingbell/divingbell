{"about_the_game":"In SATELLITE REIGN, the City is a prize fought over by corporations who bicker like squabbling children.  Block by block, district by district, market by market, they fight for control.

The pair are test-beds of cutting-edge augmentations and psychotropic conditioning protocols, and as they cut a bloody swathe across the city \u2014 always a step ahead of their rivals \u2014 Dracogenics flies ever closer to the sun.<br><br>Combat drones, murderous security guards, and ruthless corporate politics can't stop these two elite operatives, but can the city's disgruntled youth, the Resistance?<br><br>In SATELLITE REIGN, with the right upgrades, even just a few agents can make all the difference.  Is it Knight who will prove himself unstoppable?  Is it Bishop?
