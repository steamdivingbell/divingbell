{"about_the_game":"&quot;Pathfinder 2 RPG - Stolen Fate AP 2: The Destiny War<br> <br> More scattered cards of the mysterious and powerful Harrow deck known as the Deck of Destiny must be gathered before those who would use the Harrow's power to alter fate itself for their own needs can get them first. But this time, the cards come to the heroes when one of their competitors grows aggressive and attacks them in their own home. Only by gathering allies, exploring an ancient ruin, and exploring a corrupted demiplane can the heroes stand a chance over their latest enemy--a demonic mercenary who's taken an apocryphal Harrow card as his own identity. <br> <br> The Destiny War is a Pathfinder adventure for four 14th-level characters. This adventure continues the Stolen Fate Adventure Path, a three-part monthly campaign in which a band of adventurers are thrust into the role of the defenders of destiny itself. This adventure also includes new magical items and treasures to be discovered, including another 18 powerful cards from the Deck of Destiny, and a mix of monsters to torment the player characters. <br> This product is not a PDF or accessible outside of Fantasy Grounds.
