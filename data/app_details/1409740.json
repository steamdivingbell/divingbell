{"about_the_game":"Cybernetic Fault is a satirical adventure game with an anti-science storyline. The player will feel himself in the role of a romantic scientist, who is not shy about his incompetence and puts bold experiments on reality and common sense.

He doesn't have to be right at all. Sometimes the fate of the world depends on half-educated people, free from unnecessary knowledge.
