Our goal? Simply to rival big games like Quaver. Think it's tough? Think again, because this is hands down the coolest 5K rhythm game around (maybe, most likely\u2026 probably. uh)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>&quot;WHAT EVEN IS A 5K RHYTHM GAME?&quot;</strong></h2>You may be asking. Well, a rhythm game is a game where you do something to the beat, or, <strong>rhythm</strong> of the music, and your goal is to stay as accurate as possible with your timing.<br><br>In our case, our game is 5K, which means you have 5 inputs that could be tested for that accuracy at any given moment in a song. Usually, other games only hit for 4K or 7K (no idea why they pick 7 though. That's such an odd number.)<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2734590/extras/customize.png?t=1736418358\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CUSTOMIZE\u2026 EVERYTHING?!</strong></h2>We were all about making Poly Beats tailor to you from the start.

Our in-house decoration system &amp; runtime option, that lets map creators go wild with decorations, like shapes, light rays, and custom shaders! Crazy stuff, right? Plus, it's super easy with our in-game Decoration Editor. Just lay down the original Chart-Map (which is where all the notes and stuff are stored), and we're good to go!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2734590/extras/ragstoriches.png?t=1736418358\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>INNOVATIVE GAMEMODES</strong></h2>Check out our 'Rags To Riches' gamemode.

Get ready for diverse tune packs, and don't worry, we won't make you go broke.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GENEROUS REVENUE MODEL</strong></h2>Best part? Poly Beats is free!
