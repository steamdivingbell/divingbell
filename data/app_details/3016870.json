{"about_the_game":"&quot;Timeline Tangle: Which Year Again&quot; is a card game that combines historical knowledge and strategic gameplay. Players will play the role of a time and space weaver who travels through the long river of history. They use the historical event cards in their hands to arrange them in the correct chronological order to complete a series of level challenges. The game not only tests the player's understanding of historical events, but also exercises the player's memory and logical thinking ability.<br />\r\nGame rules:<br />\r\n1. Preparation for the start:<br />\r\nAt the beginning of each game, the player will get a certain number of cards, which represent different historical events or characters.<br />\r\nThe player has a certain amount of initial power to bear the penalty for wrong sorting (that is, not arranging the cards in chronological order) (the penalty is to deduct a certain amount of power).<br />\r\nAt the beginning of the game, there are already some cards in the table card area arranged in chronological order.<br />\r\n2. Game goal:<br />\r\nThe goal is to put all the cards in the table card area in the correct historical time order (that is, arranging the cards in chronological order) (there is already a public card area with cards at the beginning of the game, and these cards represent different historical events or characters).<br />\r\n3. Game process:<br />\r\nPlayers check the historical events or characters on the cards and place them in the corresponding positions on the desktop according to the time of their occurrence.<br />\r\nIf placed correctly, the card will be fixed on the desktop and cannot be moved.<br />\r\nIf placed incorrectly, the player will be deducted a certain amount of power, and the card will be discarded (that is, the card can no longer be used in this game), and the player needs to draw a new card from the deck to add to the hand.<br />\r\nPlayers can check their remaining power and number of cards at any time.<br />\r\n4. Victory and failure conditions:<br />\r\nWhen all cards are correctly placed on the desktop, the player wins and can get rewards such as fragments, silver coins and gold coins.<br />\r\nIf the player's power is deducted to 0, the game fails and no rewards will be received for this challenge.<br />\r\nGame mechanism details:<br />\r\nHistorical cards: Each card will be marked with the key years of specific events or characters. Players need to decide where to place the cards according to the order of the years.<br />\r\nPower system: Power represents the player's tolerance for error. Each incorrect placement of a card will reduce the power. When the power is exhausted, the game ends.<br />\r\nReward mechanism: After successfully completing the game, players can obtain fragments, silver coins, and gold coins. These resources can be used to unlock more cards or purchase in-game items.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3016870/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733207098","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3016870/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733207098","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3016870/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733207098","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3016870/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733207098","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Timeline Tangle: Which Year Again&quot; is a card game that combines historical knowledge and strategic gameplay.
