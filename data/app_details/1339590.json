{"about_the_game":"With multiple character archetypes to choose from, beautifully crafted 2D art, and a simplified attack system that allows players to focus on reading their opponents rather than memorizing combinations, Dextrissimi allows beginners to face-off against veteran fighters on an even playing field in a true test of instinct and skill!<br><br>Seven fighters from different nationalities come forth to prove their skill. Each character has a different play style, but they all follow the same conventions allowing players to explore their options and pick what feels best for them.<br><br>There are a couple of game modes to explore: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Arcade pits players against the toughest of champions from their respective regions. <br></li><li>Versus tests players' skills against each other in a battle to determine the strongest champion (and of course, bragging rights). </li></ul><br>This game is heavily neutral based; You have 4 face buttons that each execute attacks accordingly, leading to an easier to understand approach when engaging the opponent.
