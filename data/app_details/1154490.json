{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game- </h2><br>Grid Creeps is a Game about Tactics and Strategy which Combines Elements of Tower Defense, Base Building and Resource Management in an interesting new way.  Protect your Headquarters and survive as many Waves of Creeps as possible!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play Grid Creeps (Abridged Version)-</h2><br>To Defend your Headquarters from Creeps you will need People to man your Towers, Mine for Resources and Keep the Production Buildings running at Top Efficiency, but your People need Food and Shelter, so you will need to build Houses and Farms as well; efficiency suffers greatly if you let your Food run out or you don\u2019t have enough Houses!<br><br>Building requires Gold and Resources, but Resources also serve as Tower Ammunition, each Tower uses a different type and upgraded Towers use more- in other words; keep an eye on Managing those Resources, you don\u2019t want to run out during an attack!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survival Mode-</h2><br>This is the Original Game Mode. In Survival the Game doesn\u2019t start until you choose a place for your Headquarters. Choose your Placement wisely, your Headquarters will need access to Gold and Wood in order to expand and keep the Settlement safe. Once the Creeps start coming each wave will be Stronger, Faster and Greater in Number than the Wave before it, don\u2019t get too comfortable, even Easy Mode gets Hard if you play long enough- because the Waves Never End!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios Mode-</h2><br>This mode always provides a pre-built Base, some smaller, some larger. Some are easier than others, the Easier having plentiful Resources and a good base location with prebuilt towers/walls and other support structures. Other Bases may lack walls at all and only supply the most basic start buildings and a few basic towers not always located in the most optimal position. Scenarios is a great way for beginners to get a feel for the Game, as all of the bases have an HQ built in a reasonable location, at least 1 Wood Cutter, usually an Iron Mine and Towers to defend, giving new players a cushion of defense as they experiment and get used to the Game's mechanics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox Mode-</h2><br>This mode lets you play with some of the settings in the Game, such as time between Waves, Starting Gold Amount and how many Creeps are in the first Wave, with more options to come. Tell me what kind of Options you'd like and I will check out how feasible it is to add. This could be considered a first 'Lite' version of the planned Editor which will be expanded in the future to allow more control over the Game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Word about a Leader Board</h2><br>This is a very important feature which won't be in the first Early Access Version of the Game. I try not to promise specific features unless I know that it will make it into the Game- but this is a mandatory goal for 1.0, though hopefully I can get it in before that.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Note on supported Operating Systems</h2><br>Steam no longer supports Pre-Windows 7 Operating Systems. Once Early-Access is ended when 1.0 is released MacOS and Ubuntu will see support and if you are on Windows XP/Vista there will be ways to get a version of Grid Creeps which you can play on those Operating Systems. <br><br>On another note regarding support- once 1.0 has been released I will be researching Tablet/Phone and Web Browser versions of Grid Creeps, though the Game may not be feasible on one or all three, there are many steps between now and testing begins on these devices so right now support for these devices is a 'maybe'. Regardless of if they are feasible or not, the possibility will most definitely be explored in time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Developer-</h2><br>My Name is Dustin Bledsoe, better known as 'Sannyasi' around the Internet. I have been in Game Design as a Hobby for over a decade. I was part of the MechWarrior: Living Legends team (Wander Samurai Studio) which won some Awards and inspired MechWarrior: Online but that was a long while ago.  I have wanted to go Professional since I first got into Game Design but Life always seems to have other plans and I admit, I am attached to my family. So what to do? Make Games like this is what to do!<br><br>I remodeled for a long while for income, but it just doesn't satisfy me like getting a new feature working correctly. I had little Hobby Game Projects, but those never went anywhere, nor did I expect them to; they were usually aimed toward getting better at, or learning a new skill; It was all 3d work in CryEngine though, so moving to 2d is a change that I'm loving!<br><br>I officially started working on Grid Creeps February 2019, but preliminary work began about a year before that. I knew I wanted to get into Indie development, so before starting Production I was trying out all manner of smaller scale games and doing a lot of research. The idea was to find a Game I wanted to Play and couldn\u2019t because it didn\u2019t exist, at least that was the main criteria. When that Hunt concluded, Grid Creeps was born. Now, more than half a year later I treat this as a full time Job and am still as Passionate about this project as when I started it, I love working on it and I love playing it. I\u2019m excited to hear feedback from the Community and see the Bases and Strategies that everyone comes up with! I may not reply a lot, I am Juggling a lot of stuff, it's a bit overwhelming at times! but I read all feedback and I hope the updates themselves show it. <br><br>Thank you for your interest in Grid Creeps!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Novice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/e91158afa33633767fff2f0a6200c5246e0d4550.jpg"},{"name":"Good!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/003d7d67778406b4d77eb79ed841ed24e6ad0175.jpg"},{"name":"Epic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/7dca6bc29ec4d3ad9f58bd981b019e6b5ed9bcc2.jpg"},{"name":"Master","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/66b095d7a11cdf70f5e6aac348e79e946a461b8d.jpg"},{"name":"King","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/f1c4225556f288e7e26f7e381235ab6ab4c2c227.jpg"},{"name":"Red Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/1cec51610312c8c8c72d0fd60496a872fb6635d5.jpg"},{"name":"Green Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/50332357d8a49d3a5d03a22b56f75534d15690ac.jpg"},{"name":"Blue Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/366c98f3c9c6cffb53b67305cbdb112c36d1b195.jpg"},{"name":"Yellow Slayer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/fa17f763c23f47ae858ae9f283632d08da514a77.jpg"},{"name":"Carpenter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1154490/d5e9eadab5471657d55f3dd1fe91b1c4a5247633.jpg"}],"total":23},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1579195294","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154490/page.bg.jpg?t=1579195294","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1579195294","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1154490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1579195294","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the Game- </h2><br>Grid Creeps is a Game about Tactics and Strategy which Combines Elements of Tower Defense, Base Building and Resource Management in an interesting new way.
