{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Foulest of Spirits - Chapter Two of the Red Star Rising Campaign</h2>   <br> The Sul has risen following the last day of Carnivalle, but the morning brings no comfort. The terrifying events of the previous night still burn within your minds - and the shades of death that menaced the camp still darken your hearts. Now, some of your troupe have gone missing and others lie as if dead. And though you wish to stay and help your kin, you must complete a critical (and secret) mission in the depths of the Duskwood to find an item of great importance. But it is Darktide - a day of dire portents - and nothing is as it should be. <br> Vile monsters and grotesque undead gather in the shadowy forest - driven mad by the evil of the day. Bloodthirsty gangs of thugs prowl along the paths and roads, awaiting their chance to murder and maim. And beyond all this, something hunts your troupe - a fearful and ancient evil that burns in your dreams. Then, fires devour your people's tents, as thieves abscond with valuable Hanataz treasures! But there are more sinister plots afoot than simple arson and robbery. Baleful powers scheme in the shadows, waiting for their chance to set their murderous plans in motion. Be on your guard, for everything you believe may be false! <br> This is an adventure the like of which you have probably never seen. Along with a crafted tale that is fun to read for GMs, it also provides all manner of GM support tools and special handouts to make running the game easier while making the experience far more immersive for your players. Get the Foulest of Spirits today. And bring some more game to your table! <br> An Immersive Experience: More fun for players.
