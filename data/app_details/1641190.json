You were born in the Cloudlands during those bright days, one of the Ormfolk, forever young and strong, worshipped by those below for your forefathers\u2019 deeds. But all has gone wrong. Wolves and worse haunt the night, the law holds no sway, and men\u2019s hearts grow hard toward their gods.

During that time, he must gather and manage a warband of up to five followers, find additional artifacts, and gain soul-strength by performing godly deeds (some kindly, some cruel).
