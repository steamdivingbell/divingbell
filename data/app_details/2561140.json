{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/extras/steam02.png?t=1695031207\" /><br>Clash of Blades is an online multiplayer gladiatorial real-time sword fighting VR game with a special kill determination system - dismantling of enemy's body modules, creating a unique and groundbreaking gaming experience, and turning your dream of wielding a sword at home into reality! <br><br>This unique mechanism means that each player's body is divided into over 10 modules, one needs to accurately hit all these modules (without any specific order requirement) in order to defeat his opponent, making it one of the core innovator of real-time sword fighting games. Coupled with the Parry Mechanism from the Soul-like series, we will bring VR gamers the most intense and strategic close combat experience. And another core innovator of this game is that, with the support of MR technology, gamers can use their own feet to move, and to dodge attacks, and counterattack at the same time.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/extras/steam03.png?t=1695031207\" /><br>In the Early Access version, we will add features including real-time mechanisms (no delay in swinging), the unique victory mechanism mentioned above (defeating enemy modules one by one), and a Soul-like parry system. In addition, we will use the comic book art style to create this sword fighting game Roman Arena style.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/extras/steam04.png?t=1695031207\" /><br>The game features that will be developed in the Alpha version, including the MR Mode, Arena System, Weapon Upgrade System, Store, and Single Player Mode, etc., will be developed once the Early Access version is successfully reviewed by Steam. We are expected to spend 4-5 months to complete the development work on this Alpha version. In the mean time, we will continue to update our development progress to players who love and expect this game on a weekly basis. Stay tuned!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/extras/steam05.png?t=1695031207\" /><br>We will start developing the Early Access version of this game from Mid September and spend five weeks completing it. We will then spend an additional week optimizing and resolving any bugs in the game. A total of seven developers are expected to work on the project during these five weeks.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1695031207","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/page.bg.jpg?t=1695031207","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1695031207","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1695031207","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Join Our Discord</h1><p>","developers":["Suplife Games"],"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"},{"description":"Indie","id":"23"},{"description":"RPG","id":"3"},{"description":"Early Access","id":"70"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2561140/header.jpg?t=1695031207","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":[],"mac_requirements":[],"name":"Clash of Blades","package_groups":[],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7/8.1/10 64-bit<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel\u00aeCore\u2122i5\uff0d4590 \uff0f AMD FX\u21228350<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA\u00aeGeForce\u00aeGTX 970\uff0cAMD Radeon\u2122R9 290<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space<br></li><li><strong>VR Support:</strong> Open XR\uff0crequires motion controllers.
