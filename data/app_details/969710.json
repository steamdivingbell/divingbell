Now you can sit on the couch with a buddy (or enemy) and try to see who is the better Meatsmen. Split Screen race through chapters in order, or randomly, or race through the whole game its up to you! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want a real challenge, test out our artisanal Race Mode chapters hand forged by some of the most sadistic lunatics in our wonderful Super Meat World community!
