At least, until a shady friend replaces her broken-down housedroid as a favor. Advanced, more efficient and remarkably perceptive, unit M.A.R.A. begins to penetrate Cila's toughened exterior and possibly even heal her new owner's old wounds \u2013 if Cila can decipher the recurring nightmare the process brings. Soon Cila and Mara forge a unique - if sometimes uneasy - bond. Unbeknownst to Cila, just as her life begins to find its new normal, the technological giant Velta Labs gets wind of Mara's existence and takes a mysterious interest in the android. A war unlike any before it is brewing on the horizon, its players are silently being selected and one android's fate may spell the difference between peace, war, the blossoming of a new religion, or a technological singularity beyond comprehension.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1047010/extras/Yokostore.jpg?t=1685985424\" /><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Nearly 100 combined, unique backgrounds and CGs<br></li><li> 20+ characters, all with interesting backgrounds and personalities deeply woven into the narrative<br></li><li> An estimated 6-9 hours of gameplay<br></li><li> A unique, vibrant art aesthetic that pervades the neon dystopian setting of the game<br></li><li> A beautiful, vivid soundtrack that complements the game's aesthetic, composed by Andy Andi Han, one of the composers of <i>Katawa Shoujo</i> and <i>Sense: A Cyberpunk Ghost Story</i><br></li><li> Choices that deeply affect the protagonist's journey and world around them, with multiple endings</li></ul><br><i>Currently available in English, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.
