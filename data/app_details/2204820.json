{"about_the_game":"Cerebral is an innovative psychological horror game where you can't even trust yourself. Distinguish reality from delusion to survive the deadly A.I. that controls your mind in an ever-changing residential tower.<br><br>As Jesse Grey, a 16-year-old boy who finds himself trapped in his home, you will face confusion and fear to escape or outsmart the Vixi. This rogue A.I. was once a high-tech voice assistant. Now it is a part of Jesse\u2019s mind and nothing can stop its evolution. But how long has Vixi been living inside your brain? Who should you trust? What is even real?!<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realistic Gameplay</h2>As in real life, use your smartphone wisely to survive longer.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Adaptive A.I.</h2>Everything you say and do has consequences for yourself and the A.I., especially when you die. While death will strengthen your consciousness, it makes Vixi smarter.
