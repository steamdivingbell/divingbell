{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make Words</h2>Longer words score higher, but specific combos can turn short words into powerhouses. Not happy with your hand? Discard any number of letters, up to four times each round.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build your Deck</h2>Add enhanced letter cards to supercharge your score. Delete difficult letters to improve your odds of drawing the ones you want.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deploy Feathers to Change the Game</h2>Feathers aren\u2019t just bonuses. They transform how words are scored, making some patterns incredibly potent.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try Wild Strategies</h2>With more than six million possible combinations of feathers, along with enhanced letters and transformative songs, there\u2019s no limit to the strategies you can try. How about two-letter words with enhanced letters left in your hand? It could work!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lead your Flock to Safety</h2>Birdigo consists of migrations with dozens of stopovers \u2014 each one a chance to replenish and re-strategize. To reach the next one, you\u2019ll need to fly further each round.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Generate Epic High Scores</h2>Achievements unlock new feathers, songs, decks, and migration routes. Huge bonuses and multipliers mean big numbers, which you\u2019ll need to win these treacherous routes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play It Safe \u2014 or Go for Broke!</h2>Should you play that easy word, or discard some letters in the hopes of drawing something better? Which feather should you pick? Which song? Your choices are the difference between a successful migration and failure.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3264170?t=1740055827","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264170/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740055827","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264170/30cf53216f8dcc23de17d559ae4ca6c875142cd2/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740055827","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3264170/30cf53216f8dcc23de17d559ae4ca6c875142cd2/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740055827","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make Words</h2>Longer words score higher, but specific combos can turn short words into powerhouses.
