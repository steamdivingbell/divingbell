Her natured being derived from the essence of a hare, Fluffette struggles to keep her stately ears and tail concealed even as she attempts to adopt a human form to facilitate her endeavors in this puzzling realm. Fortunately, due to humanity's eclectic array of attire, her disguise has remained uncompromised thus far. Picking up the human art of small arms usage, Fluffette's marksmanship is as dynamic as it is unpredictable. Woefully entrapped by her hereditary instincts, when threatened, Fluffette invariably succumbs to the urge to burrow to the safety of her personal pocket dimension.<br><br>Fluffette becomes airborne when using certain skills.
