{"about_the_game":"Grow your Embraer Regional Jet fleet with the latest aircraft add-ons available for FSX: Steam Edition from FeelThere. <br><br>Based on the Embraer 145LR, which debuted at the Paris Air show in 1989, the 135LR and 145XR variants offer slightly different configurations to address different service requirements. The 135LR retains the long-range capability, but is shorter and seats fewer passengers than the 145LR. <br><br>The 145XR (Extra-long Range) seats 50 passengers and has an even longer range than the LR variant, and can be identified by its winglets. <br><br>Fly like a pro with these two well-loved regional jets, which both feature fully interactive virtual cockpits. A configuration tool can be accessed via the Tools menu in the Steam client, which enables you to tailor your airliner experience to your liking, with options such as start-up condition, payload, and much more.
