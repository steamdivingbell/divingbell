{"about_the_game":"This is the third collection of 9 in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector. Three music packs were originally designed for the Flatspace and Flatspace II games, but these were in ogg format and not compatible with the Steam release of Flatspace IIk, so when the time came to re-release the music packs I saw this as an opportunity to revisit the music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Third Music Pack for Flatspace II was released in 2013 and contained as selection of game music, and unreleased tracks. Some of these unique pieces of music are included here too, but I also wanted to include some recent music, to reflect the sort of music I compose and perform now, and also evoke feelings of space at the end of time; feelings of awe and coldness, silver, and darkness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdrift In Flat Space<br />\r\nAn original track for this Music Pack, this track is an essentially solo-piano improvisation that uses the main Flatspace theme as its source material.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJellyfish<br />\r\nA fast race of notes from the my album of catchy game-like tunes, Bites of Greatness. I wanted to make a tune full of energy and melody, like the Commodore 64 game themes I remember as a child.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParagon<br />\r\nParagon is one of the final tracks from one of my earliest albums, Animalia. Inspired by Darwinian genetics, this is a new remaster of the track, and a unique edit made for this Music Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRace The Sky<br />\r\nA supremely happy track which was originally included in the old Flatspace II Music Pack 3. It was inspired by console racing games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRequiem For A Million Skin Cells<br />\r\nComposed in 2017 for the album Cycles &amp; Shadows, this brooding piano track originally began with a droned speech about the ageing process. This is a special edit made for this music pack, an audio picture of space and vast emptiness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dying Of The Stars<br />\r\nA new track for this music pack, I wanted to include some music that had a naturalistic feeling, that could evoke the beauty and mystery of outer space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTiny Moon<br />\r\nA simple piece of music which was also present in the old Flatspace II Music Pack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaiting For The Rain To End<br />\r\nThis track evokes the passing time in a dark month. This is a unique edit of this track for this Music Pack, the full track is present on the album The Twelve Seasons.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020380/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737553918","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020380/page.bg.jpg?t=1737553918","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020380/01a7672fffe2d654f64d29f084f3bc8ba4fcd571/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737553918","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1020380/01a7672fffe2d654f64d29f084f3bc8ba4fcd571/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737553918","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This is the third collection of 9 in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk.
