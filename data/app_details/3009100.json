{"about_the_game":"Welcome to the small quiet town of Kettle Rock, cradled in the middle of nowhere in rural Idaho. This once prosperous town has now diminished to an almost-abandoned state, and it is here that Detective Lupe, a well-traversed investigator, finds themselves stranded by coincidence. While awaiting for assistance, they meet Sheriff Misra, a rookie officer within the Kettle Rock's Precinct. Lupe offers guidance in what seems like a simple break-in case at the abandoned Winery, but the mystery soon reveals a much more sinister secret within the town\u2019s history. However, something lingers in the back of Lupe\u2019s mind. Could it be feelings for their new partner in crime-solving? Or maybe an odd case of Deja Vu? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMEET THE ROOKIE is an exploration game focused on a mysterious narrative. Traverse the town, and meet a cast of mysterious characters. Lupe and Misra must work together to solve the mystery of the Kettle Rock Winery before it\u2019s too late.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717186543","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009100/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717186543","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717186543","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3009100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717186543","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Our game contains cult themes and pixelated fantasy violence & gore.
