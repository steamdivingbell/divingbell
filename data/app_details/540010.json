{"about_the_game":"An ancient tower stands in a barren land - ascend it and discover its mysterious powers. Symphony of the Machine is a meditative spatial puzzle game made specifically for virtual reality. Enter a beautiful but dead world and begin to breathe life back into it. With the help of your robot companion, use a variety of tools to manipulate an ancient machine that can control the weather. By manipulating a laser, you can create unique weather patterns needed to start regrowing the land. Watch as the landscape around you shifts and changes based on your interactions with the machine.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Greenfingers","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/71851c7c5477d388d626a8e54ba08ea92a9f2e87.jpg"},{"name":"Stormcaller","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/4c5cf1ebad71b56648b02867fdc17c981a2d4add.jpg"},{"name":"Terraformer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/96f82f2319889e7ee5b32b6507855467153d401e.jpg"},{"name":"Descendant","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/21a78ec1b33b0aa8211506fd5b27688dd92d5063.jpg"},{"name":"Not in Kansas any more","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/8e86aa76933c7a440adf1ec21016124891cdc3d5.jpg"},{"name":"Splitter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/163a4697989c6eb29d5fc67c38193782a20b6cc3.jpg"},{"name":"All the way","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/5ce983068ebeb27efa1c7eaeabfa3e69ddc7c41a.jpg"},{"name":"Bouncer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/2a876814e664c740f9d23fbfbac832d80bf70ef7.jpg"},{"name":"Breakdown","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/a1e8225ce8759c2605f60a7ac9333856523be70b.jpg"},{"name":"Pack Horse","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/540010/cc233450a2e0f2e40878bc503af14f4f99269442.jpg"}],"total":13},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/540010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1493103590","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/540010/page.bg.jpg?t=1493103590","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/540010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1493103590","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/540010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1493103590","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"An ancient tower stands in a barren land - ascend it and discover its mysterious powers.
