It is interesting and exciting to walk through the dark, to look for the way, to find out where you are, what is happening... A mixture of fascination, curiosity, partly a little scary, partly uncertainty. It's basically an exploration game - you walk, look for the way, scan walls, climb, run, jump, look for switches, smash walls, turn on lights, move stones and much more. and all this in a unique world, where this is only building up from the darkness and slowly revealing itself. The sound is great, the presentation is great! I can recommend this to every VR enthusiast.
