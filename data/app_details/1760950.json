{"about_the_game":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>The Battle off Samar was a crucial naval engagement took place on October 25, 1944, during the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf. It featured a smaller, outnumbered American task force of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts known as &quot;Taffy 3&quot; facing a powerful Japanese fleet, including battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Despite being vastly overmatched in terms of firepower and tonnage, the American forces, under the inspired and courageous leadership of Admiral Clifton Sprague, fiercely resisted the Japanese onslaught. Through aggressive attacks and reckless maneuvers, the Americans inflicted significant damage on the Japanese fleet, disrupting their plans to attack the vulnerable American amphibious landing forces in Leyte Gulf. Despite the heroic actions, the US forces lost 2 escort carriers, USS Gambler Bay and USS St. Lo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK INFO:</h2><strong>Puzzle Count:</strong> 9<br><strong>Total Piece Count:</strong> 996<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PACK CONTENTS:</h2>USS Suwannee after Kamikaze - x140<br>Laying smoke - x96<br>Sailors watch as USS Fanshaw Bay is hit - x96<br>US survivors pulled from the water - x140<br>USS Gambler Bay and escorts laying smoke - x96<br>USS Heermann laying smoke - x96<br>USS Kitkun Bay preparing Wildcats - x140<br>USS Samuel B Roberts - x96<br>USS St Lo after kamikaze - x96","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760950/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1702428100","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760950/page.bg.jpg?t=1702428100","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760950/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1702428100","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1760950/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1702428100","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Pixel Puzzles World War II, merging history with the definitive jigsaw puzzler on the PC platform.<br><br>The Battle off Samar was a crucial naval engagement took place on October 25, 1944, during the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf.
