Players are thrust into a high-stakes scenario where their character is abducted and forced to participate in a card game at gunpoint. The game setting includes graphic scenes of violence and blood, with visible remnants of previous players who did not survive. There are no depictions of sexual acts, sexual assault, or drug and alcohol abuse; however, the intense theme of coercion and life-threatening situations may be sensitive for some audiences. This content is integral to the game's storyline and atmosphere.[/i]"},"detailed_description":"<strong>A Solo Horror Card Game </strong> Set in the 1950s: Abducted and isolated in a mysterious, eerie setting, you must use your wits to escape and survive.
