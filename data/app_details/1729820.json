{"about_the_game":"After a failed genetic experiment, an eye monster was accidentally created by scientists. It had a body full of eyes, and the humans called it - very imaginatively - The Eye. The Eye rapidly took control over the whole planet, and everyone dreaded him, because he was more powerful than anything on Earth. His reign of terror lasted more than 50 years, but in the end he was destroyed in a great battle by a brave young man called Daniel. Everyone on the Earth celebrated Daniel for ending the terror of The Eye. However, the story didn't end here, even if everyone thought so at first. Somehow, one of the biggest eyes of the fallen monster was reborn, and now it poses a grave threat to mankind, just like it predecessor. Now you find yourself face to face with the great eye - as everyone calls it The Ruler Eye, as well as his eyeball minions. <strong>Don't let him take over the Earth again!</strong><br><br>You have to eliminate eyes as many as you can! The Ruler Eye is above you, he spawns new eyeball minions.
