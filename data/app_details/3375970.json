{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You awaken in a brutalist bunker, there are no explanations, only metallic echoes and the sense that you are being watched, tested by hordes of alien creatures emerging from the shadows, attacking relentlessly. Each floor is a test designed to push your limits beyond endurance. You feel you are more than human, but why? For what purpose?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are an experiment \u2014 a last resort, perhaps, or just another disposable piece in something much larger. But who put you here? And why does the world outside depend so much on what happens in this dark pit?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your only way is up, facing increasingly relentless enemies, answers buried in dark depths, and one question that keeps echoing: what will happen if you fail?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3375970/extras/newlogo.png?t=1737566799\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Main Features</strong>:<strong>Immersive Environment</strong>: Explore a bunker designed with a unique aesthetic, creating an atmosphere of tension and mystery.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Strategic Arsenal</strong>: Use distinct weapons, each offering a unique approach to combat and suiting your playstyle.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Aiming Skill</strong>: The game is designed for players who value precision.
