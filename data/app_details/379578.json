{"about_the_game":"Designed by air racer Steven Wittman, the Tailwind is an amateur-built two-seat aircraft first built in the 1950s. Combining relatively low build costs with exciting 200-mph performance, the Tailwind proved a success and more than 350 examples have been built. Different versions of the basic design offer different engine specs and performance, as well as either tail-dragger or tricycle-type undercarriages.  <br><br>The Wittman Tailwind for FSX: Steam Edition, developed by Lionheart Creations, includes both the W8 (tail-dragger) and W10 (tail-dragger and tri-gear) series model variants. The two W series aircraft both fly slightly differently, with the W-10 having a higher-performance engine than the W-8.  The W-10 will cruise at 180 MPH and will max out at 200 MPH, whereas the W-8 cruises at 140 to 160 MPH and maxes out at 180 MPH.
