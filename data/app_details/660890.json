Scholars of the guild, known as the wizards of Magus, studied the arcane of magic in the fields of alchemy, astronomy and astrology. Only through decades of study could the most devoted wizards master the arts of magic.

Hyperspace drives create rifts through time-space allowing access to a time altered dimension known as hyperspace allowing for faster than light travel.
