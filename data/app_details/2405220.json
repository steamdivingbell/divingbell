{"about_the_game":"Bf-109 G-6AS has been designed as a high-altitude interceptor and appeared in the Western Europe skies during late Spring 1944. 686 aircraft were built, 226 from scratch and 460 upgraded from G-6 modification aircraft during the repairs. The engine, DB605AS, was a modification of the DB605A.
