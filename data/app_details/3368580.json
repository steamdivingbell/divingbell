{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Loki is up to no good, as always. Having thrown a wild party that has left much of Asgard in ruin, he avoided punishment for his misdeeds by deceiving Oden into believing that Thor was responsible for the damage. Oden's rage was extreme, leaving him unable to be reasoned with, and his punishment upon Thor was severe. Now stripped of all his power except the ability to move the wind, you play as Thor, tirelessly working to repay his debts to regain his powers, one delivery at a time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Enjoy:</p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">2D/3D platforming over 40 levels spread across 6 different zones</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Physics based gameplay (use the power of wind to deliver your package as fast as you can)</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Compete against others for the best times with global leaderboards</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Lore that will blow your socks off</p></li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3368580?t=1734707508","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3368580?t=1734707508","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3368580/682b5b79999179a8a7e34d7959f9b3f6c8a5af3b/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734707508","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3368580/682b5b79999179a8a7e34d7959f9b3f6c8a5af3b/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734707508","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Loki is up to no good, as always.
