{"about_the_game":"<br><br><br><strong>Your corporation, after hundreds of dangerous experiments in which many scientists died, finally managed to create the perfect DNA code that allows you to breed dangerous, sinister beasts of unknown origin.

In Kaiju Commander, you will have several bases that will allow you to attack different locations on the map. Thanks to the extensive system of bases, you will develop other, more powerful Kaiju types to help fight you with your opponents. Most of the time you will be located in secret, hard-to-reach underwater locations. But you can't feel at ease because the enemy will want to destroy you and the Kaiju you had bred.<br><br><strong>GATHER RESOURCES</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1756430/extras/Gather_resources.png?t=1713256604\" /><br>In a strategy game, collecting resources is one of the elements that will allow you to develop your headquarters during the game. You will have to generate resources from special places of power which - depending on the location of your base - will be available to a greater or lesser extent. Properly balanced extraction and exchange of resources between your bases are the key aspects of your development.<br><br><strong>GROW A POWERFU KAIJU</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1756430/extras/Grow_a_powerful_Kaiju2.png?t=1713256604\" /><br>Developing your base and collecting raw materials are just some of the tasks you will have to deal with during your playthrough. Your goal will be to dominate the world, and for that, you will need to breed mighty Kaiju! In your bases, you will be able to upgrade your monsters and change their DNA code so that they have different destructive powers. Additionally, you will be able to arm your Kaiju with special equipment. Controlling them is not so simple - those beasts want to destroy and wreak complete chaos. You can satisfy them only by sending them on missions against your opponents. Take care of them in the right way, and you will gain their devotion and loyalty.<br><br><strong>DOMINATE THE WORLD</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1756430/extras/Dominate_the_world.png?t=1713256604\" /><br>The development of your base and powerful Kaiju will have an impact on the level of domination in a specific zone of the world.
