{"about_the_game":"Brickbuilder VR is a high-fidelity VR model building simulator. With both decorative blocks and mechanical components such as axels, gears and motors, the game enables you to build a wide variety of interesting creations that move and interact with each other in the virtual world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrickbuilder VR features 2 primary modes of play: &quot;blueprints&quot;, which lets you re-create structures that we have designed, and &quot;freeform&quot;, which is building from a blank slate. At launch, Brickbuilder VR includes 10 blueprints. More will be added as we add more features and content to the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is also designed with extensions in mind: it will be possible to create a blueprint from an existing build directly from within the game. We will also release an official SDK, which will provide the functionality to create custom pieces, 3D models, and textures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBrickbuilder VR is at an early stage of its development. In addition to performance improvements, UI-overhauls, and bug fixes, we plan to add the following features to the game in the future: pistons / linear actuators; lights; sensors and graph programmability; script programmability; propellers / flying interactions; magnetic joints; and many more. Your support will help us make these a reality.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1665570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1627757696","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1665570/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1627757696","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1665570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1627757696","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1665570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1627757696","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Brickbuilder VR is a high-fidelity VR model building simulator.
