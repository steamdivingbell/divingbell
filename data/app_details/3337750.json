{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Want to beat up a certain politician? This is your healthy, legal outlet to do so! This satire parody game explores the idea of what if politicians stopped holding back and let loose their mighty wrath upon each other for the right to rule the oval office. With recreated motion-captured faces and stunningly realistic models, you can feel the sweet sweet catharsis of every punch to your least favorite politician's face.  <br><br>This game utilizes a hybrid 2D and 2.5D fighting mechanics wherein the combat shifts perspective with every hyper attack. With each battle, unique comedic satire voice acted dialogue sets up the fight as you explore the story modes for each candidate for the presidency. Each super and hyper combo attack is a work of parody and will get you laughing as you outmaneuver your opponent. Go head to head in fierce local multiplayer combat.\u00a0<br><br>Each fighter carries a robust move set that is based on famous political moments. Bask in the inside jokes and explore the dynamic movesets of fighters on all sides of the political spectrum! Regardless of who you choose, you'll have a dynamic, unique move set that will allow you to claim the oval office with vengeance. <br><br>Face off head-to-head in local multiplayer against a friend, or fight the good fight solo in a full story mode that is uniquely tailored for each fighter!\u00a0<br><br>Beyond the comedy and satire, this game demonstrates a new approach to fighting games, taking the traditional 2D fighter formula full of high-low mix-ups on block, and combining it with a breakable shield mechanic from your favorite platform fighter. All this gets flipped on its head if someone does a special move or hits with a Right-Trigger &quot;Liberty Attack&quot;, which will transform the battle into a 2.5D fighter. The changeup in controls and camera orientation force the players to outmaneuver each other and out predict each other's attacks.\u00a0 Explore the complex gameplay that weaves between 2D and 2.5d fighting mechanics into a political smackdown you wont soon forget!</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3337750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735882906","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3337750/page.bg.jpg?t=1735882906","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3337750/7baaad6b9947001550bfbd777498ae79eb904866/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735882906","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3337750/7baaad6b9947001550bfbd777498ae79eb904866/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735882906","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Want to beat up a certain politician?
