{"about_the_game":"Haste: Broken Worlds is a fast-paced running game where you race to reach the portal at the end of a collapsing universe. Run through an infinite amount of levels where no world is ever the same. Between each attempt to complete your run you have the chance to explore a hub world, gather your strength, meet characters and practice your skills before heading out for another adventure. Each run has its own unique challenges with clues to figure out why the worlds are breaking apart.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>RUN</strong></h2>There's only one way to do this - run fast! Speed your way through a variety of levels and gather as much speed as you can before the collapsing world reaches up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MASTER YOUR LANDINGS</strong></h2>To reach the portal at the end of each level before it collapses, you\u2019ll need to master your landing skills to maintain good speed. When you inevitably crash into something or otherwise fail to reach the portal you will get a new attempt to complete the run from the beginning!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THINKING ON YOUR FEET</strong></h2>Each world is different from the last so you always have to think on your feet, read the environment around you, and be ready for anything! Each level has a range of challenges to keep you on your toes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ENDLESS PLAY</strong></h2>With procedural level generation the marathon never ends, there are an infinite number of levels for the most hardcore of sprinters. Play again and again as you build up abilities and skills to master any course!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIND ANSWERS</strong></h2>If one thing is going to make you philosophical, it's hours spent running - find out why the universe is falling apart before you stumble and fall.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1730715228","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796470/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1730715228","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1730715228","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1796470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1730715228","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Haste: Broken Worlds is a fast-paced running game where you race to reach the portal at the end of a collapsing universe.
