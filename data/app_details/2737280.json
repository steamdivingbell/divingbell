A reluctant fighter, he wields the tools of the trade, ranging from his childhood slingshot to his wooden bow and the flute he learned to play to earn Aurora\u2019s heart. How naive was Breeze and unsuspecting he was that he would receive a spirit guide of his own, the less-than-loyal Kermi-tsu!<br><br>Chieftess Aurora, the fierce, selfless and beautiful leader of Tsukamish Village, who has come of age and must prove herself in the eyes of her adoring people. Her mastery of wind and aurora magic is unrivaled, except for her ancient ancestress and spitting image, Aura. She is a master of meditation and known for her profound spiritual powers which were such that the Owl Spirit Kiya-Kayu descended to earth to be her mentor in a time of looming crisis.<br><br>Kermi-tsu, the legendary frog and notorious trickster, the breaker of hearts and wielder of Cherry Bonsai, a divine staff. He broke the heart of the masterful samurai, Amorita, his beloved Amanita mushroom queen, through his affair with a woman with hair of gold. A known philanderer and a mischievous frog, what an irony it is that the Lord of the Sky assigned him to be the spirit guide to the eternally loyal Breeze.<br><br>Be careful not to encroach on the territory of little Keeku, the Badgerborn, whose birth was celebrated by an army of badgers who wandered into Tsukamish Village to celebrate her joining the sacred forest. With her mastery of nature and forest magic, and the ferocious sharpness of her claws, Keeku is beyond formidable, especially for her age. She\u2019s territorial too, and is of the night, do not be the raccoon that visits her tree uninvited lest you risk facing her wrath and a fatal slash of her badger claws. Will she listen to her spirit guide, the patient Bear Spirit Blossom, with her maternal wisdom and her mastery of the ways of the forest?<br><br>A wise heart, sweet disposition, and immortal beauty define the loveliness of Lunaria, the Lunar Priestess who is the divine embodiment of the moon. Known for her myriad of lovers, and the occasional quarrel, the only fortune she cannot fully read is her own. But she has a lover\u2019s heart, and as lovers tend to do, she finds herself smitten, this time with the mortal but incredibly mighty sumo champion, Rikishi. She may be gentle of disposition, divinely so, but don\u2019t underestimate the power of her lunar magic, or her willingness to use her feminine charms and the occasional explosive rocket.<br><br>For seven years Rikishi held the title of the reigning sumo champion! Now he finds himself in the cozy employment of the Princess of Japan, for whom he serves as a loyal and trustworthy bodyguard. Beware the barrel of his chest, his mastery of fire breathing, and his willingness to ignite the occasional bottle of Sake in an explosive toss. This charming, handsome, and rugged fellow\u2019s love affair with with Lunaria was, if unexpected, inevitable.<br><br>The cantankerous but undeniably wise Owl Spirit, Kiya-Kayu, the Guardian of the Gate for the Lord of the Sky, Koaku. Assigned to mentor Chieftess Aurora in her time of need, even Kiya-Kayu has his fickleness and complexities - he serves the lord, but he also stole his divine mountain herb, to partake with his old companion Kermi-tsu. How frequently Kermi-tsu teases Kiya-Kayu on account of his feathers which have come to know grayness as the timeless spirit ages through the eons!<br><br>Will the blind samurai Amorita, the scorned lover of Kermi-tsu, attain her vengeance and reclaim her honor? Her husband, her lover, the infamous Kermi-tsu, cheated on her and broke her heart. Once more she has descended to the Earth, which for many years she had abandoned in her heartbreak and misery. But this year, she will participate in the tournament honoring Koaku, and there is a frog whose life she intends to take. Will she succeed, or will she die in her former lover\u2019s arms?<br><br>Last but far from least is the motherly, occasionally savage, and perpetually honey-seeking Bear Spirit, Blossom. With a flower on her head, and claws on her paws, Blossom is a juxtaposition of sweetness and ferocity, perhaps not so different from her little apprentice, Keeku. Loving and motherly, Blossom is truly the most nurturing of spirit guides, and takes pride in her work serving the Lord of the Sky, Koaku. You won\u2019t catch her smoking stolen herbs of the sky, though you better lock up your stash of honey.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2737280/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726717081","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2737280/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726717081","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2737280/861b9de8aadd1cbc5af03a2c0b7431115e41c3a5/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726717081","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2737280/861b9de8aadd1cbc5af03a2c0b7431115e41c3a5/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726717081","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2737280/extras/BannerOurVision.png?t=1726717081\" /><br>WARRING WINDS is a story-rich multiplayer fighting game that takes place on an alternate history of earth where the winds of fate and the whims of the gods have intervened and brought magic to the world in a time of crisis.
