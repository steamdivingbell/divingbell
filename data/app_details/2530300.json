The ejected surveyor collided at high speed with an unexpected obstacle in the air, causing the parachute system to go offline. The surveyor then free-fell uncontrollably, and despite the strong protection of the exploration suit, the impact couldn't be entirely mitigated. The grappling hook device &quot;XiaoShouGong No.73&quot; (distributed AI robot, player's perspective), installed on the surveyor's right arm, also suffered some damage.<br>After landing and becoming stationary, XiaoShouGong No.73 began a self-check.
