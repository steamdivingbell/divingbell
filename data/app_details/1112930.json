Dredgers are the men and monsters who all desire the gold and power lying in the dungeons beneath the earth. As a dredger you'll be exploring dungeons, looking for gold, potions, scrolls, food and more to further your endless descent into the depths. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1112930/extras/Buuum.gif?t=1720841922\" /><br><br>As you slay enemies in your way, you'll earn experience which affords you higher stats, new classes and new skills. Deflect enemy projectiles as a fencer or call down devastating beams of light as a priest. Maybe you prefer leaving the grunt work to your followers as a summoner or lich? Or perhaps you prefer having excellent equipment instead, taking the blacksmith and artificer classes.<br><br>Even better, why not be all of the above?
