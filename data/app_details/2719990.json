{"about_the_game":"<u><strong>A DESTROYED BUSINESS</strong></u><br>In a small city, there was a man with only one wish: to save his business from failure. The man did not want to accept the pain and tried to find a way to fix it. He tried everything he could, but nothing worked. It almost seemed that he was destined to fail.<br><u><strong>THE BOOK</strong></u><br>One day, while searching for a document in his room, he found a book that wasn\u2019t supposed to be in his house. The book was full of dust, so he cleaned it up and saw the title of the book, \u2018Into The Unknown\u2019. Everything in the book was about ancient creatures and maps that lead to them, but there was only one specific thing he found interesting, and that was a portal that led to a maze with gold statues. The person who collects all of them will be sent home. There was also a map that showed the exact location of the portal.<br><u><strong>THE ADVENTURE</strong></u><br>The man didn\u2019t wait a second and grabbed everything he needed for this adventure. The location of the portal is in the mountains, so only the strongest will have the choice to enter or not.<br><u><strong>THE NEXT CHAPTER</strong></u><br>How will the story of the game continue? Did the man find the portal, escape the maze, and save his business? Or did he die? This part of the story is up to you.<br><u><strong>THE GAME</strong></u><br>The game works really simply. You will find yourself in the mountains and need to locate the portal. Use the portal to find the maze and collect all the golden statues to save your business. It sounds too simple to be real.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1707070203","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1707070203","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707070203","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2719990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707070203","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The monster is zombified, a lot of blood and has an open abdomen."},"detailed_description":"<u><strong>A DESTROYED BUSINESS</strong></u><br>In a small city, there was a man with only one wish: to save his business from failure.
