The goal is that the world in one server and world is in same screen.

According to the plan, a battle in Chibi, a small-scale battle, requires 400000 people to be online on the same screen, 5-20tbps bandwidth single map server, which needs 50000 times of server bandwidth at that time. According to Moore's law, it will take 50 years, but these 20 The annual performance of the network server only increased by 2-5 times, which led to MMORPG only giving up the world map, giving up the user's social interaction and opening more copies, leading to the game transforming into the online krypton gold stand-alone game, which eventually went to failure. Therefore, the realization of 10000 people listening to the bow and arrow rain is expected to stay ahead of the world for 30 years and achieve the only real-time war experience in the world. At present, HereticOS  Mr Lab for war simulator has been initially formed. The output bandwidth of 100000 people on a single map and a screen is 200g, which can realize the real-time battlefield of 10000 people listening to the bow and arrow rain on a small scale. For example, the 2D online games are generally the same as the map service 2000 units and the screen 200 units, the field of vision is 50m, the 3D online games are the same as the map service 800 units, the screen 50 units and the field of vision is 200m, while a typical bow and arrow rain needs 1500m field of vision, and the archer 2 units More than 10000 people listen to the effect of bow and arrow rain. At present, the effect of bow and arrow rain will only appear in the movie works. For example, the movie of Lord of the rings needs to serve 100000 units on the same screen, with a vision of 6000 meters, and the same screen needs to accommodate four scenes of bow and arrow rain. Therefore, the Metaverse online game effect of the movie of Lord of the rings will be the only experience in the world in 30 years","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1300140?t=1674675381","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1300140?t=1674675381","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300140/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1674675381","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1300140/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1674675381","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong> Introduction </strong><br><br>HereticOS MR  war simulator is a target version of HereticOS virtual reality lab.
