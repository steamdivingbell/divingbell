{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a remote medieval town burdened with plague, you play as a bloodthirsty vampire lurking in the shadows of a dark alleyway. Arriving late from your nightly hunt, you must attack unsuspecting prey and drink their blood to survive the harsh daylight. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Bloodlust is a short narrative exploration game in which you play as Vandor, a vampire desperately trying to survive in the daytime. Your only goal is to quench your bloodlust by taking down the plagued townspeople to give yourself enough strength to reach the safety of your castle. The game features a\u00a0dark and gothic environment, an engaging story and a vampire blood drinking mechanic.  Bloodlust was a solo project produced in Unreal Engine 5 by Laela Russell (Environment artist) as a Ringling College thesis project in 2024.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729435817","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231130/page.bg.jpg?t=1729435817","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231130/23ffa0424c1c2766b995181a7d32075fdf39ede4/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729435817","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3231130/23ffa0424c1c2766b995181a7d32075fdf39ede4/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729435817","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a remote medieval town burdened with plague, you play as a bloodthirsty vampire lurking in the shadows of a dark alleyway.
