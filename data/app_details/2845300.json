{"about_the_game":"You like <strong>Racing</strong>? How about <strong>Mazes</strong>? In this game, you are gonna get the best of both worlds... but guess what?... Lights out too! Get ready to race your friends (or strangers) through randomly generated mazes to see who's the fastest at navigating in the dark. The first lap may be slow, but don't fret, the correct path will be lit as you continue through the labyrinth.<br><br>Blinding Speed will have 2 different modes of interaction: Racing Mode (local or online racing) and Spectator Mode if you'd rather watch others race. Players in Racing mode will be spread across evenly around the track, and each has their own lap line on their starting position. For those in Spectator Mode, you will be able to see the full Maze/Track. Some could potentially use that info for unethical purposes like CHEATING. To combat that, the color of the cars will be randomized along with the rotation of the track (hence a circular track). By time they figure out who's who, they will already be behind and the advantage is gone.<br><br>Also to prevent &quot;griefing&quot;, players will be ghosts to each other so the only focus should be getting through maze.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2845300/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735857947","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2845300/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735857947","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2845300/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735857947","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2845300/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735857947","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You like <strong>Racing</strong>?
