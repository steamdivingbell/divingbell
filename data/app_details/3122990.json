{"about_the_game":"Elder Legacy: Survival is a cooperative survival game and the second game in the Elder Legacy series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat does this game offer compared to the original Elder Legacy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game features its own separate, expansive world, locations, enemies, bosses, and is based on different concepts. While Elder Legacy is a story-driven role-playing adventure, Elder Legacy: Survival is a fun co-op experience in a vast open world where you and your friends will find ways to defeat bosses and progress through biomes together. This game focuses on the concept of cooperative survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike the serious tone of the original game, Elder Legacy: Survival has a more parodic nature, filled with numerous references, jokes, and humor. The game aims to entertain with its unique setting and provide a cheerful atmosphere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo defeat the bosses, you will have to create many items, workbenches, gather resources, and much more. Each member of your team will have their own role \u2014 mage, archer, or warrior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also features building, as you will need a place to live, cook food, create items, and store things. And, eventually, there must be a place for the trophy head of a lizard.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1729893662","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1729893662","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729893662","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3122990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729893662","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Elder Legacy: Survival is a cooperative survival game and the second game in the Elder Legacy series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat does this game offer compared to the original Elder Legacy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game features its own separate, expansive world, locations, enemies, bosses, and is based on different concepts.
