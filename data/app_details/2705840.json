{"about_the_game":"Series production of the Standard II vehicles developed by the Association of Public Transport Companies (V\u00d6V) began at MAN in 1984. Alongside the vehicles from Mercedes and Neoplan, the vehicles shown here mainly characterised the (West) German streetscape. After reunification, these vehicles also found customers in the rest of the country and in Eastern Europe, where they can still be found in regular service today. Licensed bodies have also made it to the other side of the world. <br>Now players can experience the Standard II buses from MAN for themselves on the PC. The &quot;MAN Standardbus II&quot; add-on for OMSI 2 includes the &quot;MAN S\u00dc242&quot; intercity bus, the &quot;MAN SL202&quot; city bus and the &quot;MAN SG292&quot; articulated city bus, all built in 1992 and now more than 30 years old.<br>Thanks to their modular design, all vehicles can be completely customised. Doors, destination and interior displays, gearbox and engine variants, lighting or instrument panel - over 20 customisation options per vehicle allow the player to create their dream vehicle.<br>City and city articulated buses are also available with individual interior variants (with or without multi-purpose area for bulky goods, wheelchairs, bicycles or pushchairs) as well as seat variants (individual seats or bench seats). The interurban coach is equipped with 3 different seat types.<br>All vehicles are ready for use with a city bus front mask (large matrix box, two windscreens) as well as with the interurban front mask (St\u00dcLB, small matrix box, one-piece windscreen).  <br>This add-on therefore offers a total of 8 individual vehicles of type SG292, 8 individual vehicles of type SL202 and 6 individual vehicles of type S\u00dc242, which can be further customised with the above-mentioned options.
