{"about_the_game":"100 Kills Challenge is a fast-paced first person shooter, combining the bloody reality of modern combat with a return to basics: Kill one hundred enemies before anyone else. How you do it is up to you: Be brutal, be clever, fight on your own or as part of a team, just be the first to reach one hundred kills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember the rules: There are none. All that matters is reaching one hundred kills: Fighting as a lone wolf in 12 player deathmatch, as part of Blue or Red teams in team deathmatch, or facing a computer-controlled onslaught in our brutal PVE modes. And remember: The amount of ways to kill will increase, as the game is being constantly expanded and developed!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 100 KILLS CHALLENGE ORIGINS: Only the death match mode and 2 maps are open, with a total of 19 weapons to choose from. The official version will have a team death match mode, 12 maps, and more than 40 weapons.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1712593085","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784540/page.bg.jpg?t=1712593085","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1712593085","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2784540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1712593085","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>ADD TO WISHLIST</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>100 Kills Challenge is a fast-paced first person shooter, combining the bloody reality of modern combat with a return to basics: Kill one hundred enemies before anyone else.
