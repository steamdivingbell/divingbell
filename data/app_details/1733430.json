It features a node calculator for farmers to know how many nodes of each type they need to get a specific amount of one resource. An eco-raid and a raiding calculator to figure out how much boom you need based on what you're trying to raid through and how many of them you're trying to go through. A resource calculator based off of what type of boom you're trying to make and a cloth to scrap converter with more features coming soon.<br><br><i>*Note* I am still working on adding features so the current version is not the finished version of the software.
