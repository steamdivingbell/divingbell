{"about_the_game":"InController is a 4-player couch co-op within a couch co-op. Inside InController you will find different game modes that bring an nostalgic feel and gameplay. Work with your teammate to control your onscreen controller by running and jumping over the buttons on your teams controllers (you can even mess with the other teams controls!) to control your teams character in the selected game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrent game modes to choose from are &quot;Who Gave that Duck a Gun?&quot;, fight to collect the gun and the bullet to shoot the other teams character in a fast-paced back and forth platform battler. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn &quot;Carmadillo&quot;, work together to knock the hapless armadillo into the opposing teams goal. Talk about driving your teammate crazy!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Save Yourself&quot;, the 3rd game, is dungeon crawling madness. Your team plays as a princess who needs to save herself from the depths some random dungeon. Problem is, only one princess can survive! Be the first to find the key and escape, but watch out, chests can be trapped by the other team! You may even find some extra goodies to help Save Yourself!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore game modes will follow soon!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735420337","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735420337","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735420337","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2600170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735420337","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2653350,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"InController is a 4-player couch co-op within a couch co-op.
