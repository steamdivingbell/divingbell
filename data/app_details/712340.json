{"about_the_game":"After two years of lightning victories all across northern Europe, the German army has suffered its first major setback in the war. The great offensive to the east - the invasion of the Soviet Union - has stalled right in front of the gates of Moscow.<br><br>Following the relentless defense of their capital city, the Soviets have launched several major counter-attacks during the harsh winter of 1941. German forces are forced to retreat and regroup, but must maintain their position in reach of Moscow. Once the Soviet attacks have been broken and the strength of the Panzer Divisions is replenished the offensive will resume - until total victory has been achieved.<br> <br><strong>Panzerkrieg</strong>, the new expansion for Order of Battle - WW2 forms the second part of the German Grand Campaign, following the previously released Blitzkrieg DLC. Players can start the Panzerkrieg campaign from scratch, or import their core force from the end of the Blitzkrieg campaign - including all the previously unlocked commanders and specializations.
