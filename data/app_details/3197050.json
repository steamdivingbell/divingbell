Violence, as in Aristotle and Shakespeare, is not an end in itself but a means to achieve catharsis. The &quot;catharsis of events&quot; is a concept originating in ancient Greece, particularly associated with Aristotle\u2019s theatrical works. It refers to a process of purifying or liberating emotions through artistic expression or emotional participation in a work of art. When we witness dramatic or tragic events, such as those depicted in a play or film, we experience a sort of &quot;purging&quot; of our emotions, helping us to release accumulated tensions or anxieties.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Catharsis Through Violence: A Parallel with Aristotle and Shakespeare</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Aristotle defined catharsis as the purification of emotions through drama, as seen in the fall of Oedipus or the assassination of Agamemnon. Similarly, Shakespeare used violence in works like Macbeth or Julius Caesar to shake the audience, leading them to reflect on human nature and their own fears. In .redruM, the use of violence might be understood as a way to make users experience this emotional catharsis, through direct engagement with universal themes like death and loss. It is not mere horror, but a vehicle for art and reflection, just like in the great dramas of the past.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197050/extras/3_Gif_redruM.gif?t=1733070207\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>The Collapse of Reality: Liminal Spaces and Broken Dreams</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The aesthetics of liminal spaces and backrooms further reinforce this experience, creating an environment where every corner suggests that something is profoundly wrong, a place where reality itself seems on the verge of collapse, just like the dreams and aspirations of the protagonists.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733070207","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197050/page.bg.jpg?t=1733070207","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197050/bc1917b88b237b5a0545451a7ee40bfa0d166f95/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733070207","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3197050/bc1917b88b237b5a0545451a7ee40bfa0d166f95/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733070207","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"In creating the levels of .redruM, I did not limit myself to traditional game design but sought to evoke the emotions that accompany the final moments of great artists.
