{"about_the_game":"For years, Dorman did his best to follow in his missing parents\u2019 footsteps and become a great sailor responsible for charting the ever-changing islands. But he has a secret - he wishes he was born as a girl. <br><br>Dorman, a closeted trans woman, has just finished recovering from a sailing incident that left her bedridden when her grandmother encourages her to start a new career. All the while, she struggles with her melancholy about the expectations her parents left behind - of her as a sailor and as \u2018man of the house\u2019. <br><br>As she begins to settle back into her life, she finds that Two Elk Island isn\u2019t as tranquil as she remembers - a group of poachers has begun to disturb the balance between humans and spirits. The resident witch, Rue, seeks her help preventing calamity from befalling the island. The local healer, Lantana, can\u2019t keep up with the influx of new patients caused by the worsening storms. A prince from faraway Castle Island, Valerian, offers to pay any price for the treasure he seeks. And Dorman\u2019s childhood friend, Gallardia, suggests she return to sailing, fulfilling her family legacy.<br><br>In addition to saving Two Elk Island and getting closer to a chosen partner, Dorman realizes she can no longer ignore her gender dysphoria. After reflecting on her past and what she wants for her future, Dorman comes out as Poppy, now using \u2018she\u2019 and \u2018her\u2019 pronouns. <br><br>As Poppy finds her relationship becoming romantic with either Gallardia, Lantana, Rue, or Valerian, she seeks self-love and helps her chosen partner find it as well. Together, it\u2019s up to them to save Two Elk Island from destruction. <br><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2257130/extras/banner.png?t=1672256501\" /><br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2257130/extras/gallardiabanner.png?t=1672256501\" /><br><br>Gallardia is our heroine's childhood friend, a proud big brother to three younger siblings, and a beloved sailor of Two Elk Island.
