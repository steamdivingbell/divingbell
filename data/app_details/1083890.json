Face Cylon threats old and new, and battle side-by-side with the CIC crew of the Galactica. Play through ten fully-voiced story missions, and thirteen Resource Missions that can be scouted for intel before committing your forces. Features four new tracks from composer Ash Gibson Greig, two story cinematics, and a cast of both new and familiar voices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New war room</h2>The Ministry of Defense relies on Galactica to lead the counter-offensive against the Cylons. Organize and command BSG-75 from a meticulous reconstruction of the famous Galactica CIC.  The Season Two strategy layer has been revamped to get you straight into the fights that matter, while the new Cylon Threat mechanic measures your overall impact on the First Cylon War.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New ships</h2>The Jupiter-class battlestar you know and love has been overhauled. The Jupiter Mk II boasts enough firepower and armour to become the most impressive vessel yet fielded in the war, with that authentic familiar look fans have been waiting for. <br>The Cylons have not been idle during the ceasefire either. When taking the field, Cylon Command have begun to exploit the raw firepower of the rare Cratus-class basestar, an impressive behemoth of a ship that serves as a mobile operational base.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New squadrons</h2>The Colonials have retrofitted an ancient fighter design with a mysterious origin. Dubbed the Taipan, these hardy fighters are heavy hitting anti-capital strike vehicles. Meanwhile, the Cylons have developed the Vespid, a swarm of dedicated bombers that quickly close the distance and release high yield explosives on their targets.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1567087285","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083890/page.bg.jpg?t=1567087285","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1567087285","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1083890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1567087285","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Three years ago, the betrayal of the Kobol Alliance cut deep.
