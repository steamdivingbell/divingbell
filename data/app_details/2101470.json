{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Magical Elements</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spellstruck currently offers a selection of 8 elements that cater to all manner of playstyles. From all out brute force, to a strong defence and even styles of a more exciting nature. Each of these elements consist of 3 attacks that represent different levels of power. A basic spell that can be powered up in different ways, a secondary and an ultimate. Both of the latter offer a range of effects that can be used together, and with those from other elements to create interesting combos.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Familiar game modes are available, with 2 more that make use of various spells in interesting ways. From simple elimination rounds to balancing the defence of your own totem with the attack of your enemies. Currently all modes are 1v1 for testing but player count will increase in the near future.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Buffs and Weapons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Elemental buffs offer players various boosts including speed, damage, and shields that will give you a much-needed edge in combat. Weapons on the other hand give you alternative ways to stick it to your enemy. Both appear at random intervals and locations throughout the arena and are stored to be unleashed at the perfect time. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mana Management</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Power isn\u2019t limitless in Spellstruck and different attacks and defences are of different costs to the player. Each element has its own pool of power for basic moves as well as ability cooldowns that players will have to manage effectively in order to win. Be careful though because you may find yourself all out of resources and stuck frantically on the defence.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101470/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1731937738","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101470/page.bg.jpg?t=1731937738","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101470/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1731937738","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2101470/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1731937738","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Magical Elements</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spellstruck currently offers a selection of 8 elements that cater to all manner of playstyles.
