{"about_the_game":"Uncle Groucho is your guide in a wacky alternative Hollywood where cigars are currency and you are as likely to travel in a space shuttle as in a covered wagon. Designed in 1983 by Mel Croucher, the British videogame pioneer, this bizarre graphically-augmented text-adventure for the ZX Spectrum showcased Mel's unique brand of humour. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Using simple text commands, move around Hollywood searching for Groucho and his friend the Piman. Fat cigars are your currency, and can be won by doing things like gambling at a casino or betting on horses. Finding Groucho gives you chances to have hints revealed to you about a certain celebrity figure. When this game was originally released, players could send in their mystery celebrity name guesses to the game's publisher, Automata UK, to be entered into a prize draw for a trip to Hollywood on Concorde! Unfortunately, players of this version will be a little late to the party, as the prize was already won back in 1984 by Phil Daley from Stoke-on-Trent.<br><br><br>This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Saving/loading the game at any point<br></li><li> Support for most modern game controllers<br></li><li> Full control remapping<br></li><li> Image scaling and smoothing options</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461750/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1687424149","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461750/page.bg.jpg?t=1687424149","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461750/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687424149","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2461750/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687424149","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Uncle Groucho is your guide in a wacky alternative Hollywood where cigars are currency and you are as likely to travel in a space shuttle as in a covered wagon.
