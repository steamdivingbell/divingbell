{"about_the_game":"Little Triangle has the most complete platformer experience among many others. All three game modes including single player mode, local co-op mode and local mini Battle Royale mode are all well polished and hilarious! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe originally target the same price with only the single player content! We listened to test players' feedback and added the hilarious multiplayer content! All the content were tested by many players and polished to make sure they are fun before the release!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game offers more than 60 cute and funny triangle skins, countless kinds of enemies, a bunch of bosses and amusing level designs with tons of details. This game is extremely easy to pick up and the fun comes immediately when you start to play. It aims to be one of the most exciting and hilarious party game while also retain great fun in solo mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe solo and 2-4 player platformer mode features jumping as its core playing experience and two difficulty levels, casual or hardcore, are available for players to choose from. You can play solo or invite up to four friends to start a multiplayer game. The gameplay appears simple, just control little triangle to clear the level using jump or double jump. However, it can be quite challenging especially since each level offers a dramatically different design.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mini Battle Royale is an enhanced mode with different mechanics and is aiming to deliver a hilarious experience. The move and jump are the same as the platformer mode, but to win you must learn how to attack and hide. It is proved to be the most engaging mode that friends and family can always enjoy and have fun. You can attack opponents by either jumping onto their heads or using various kinds of weapons and utilizing different mechanics in each map.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"First step","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/5e1cceb53c3240fc6adb467741b38dc950580ac7.jpg"},{"name":"First blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/108ef54fef31000d2e04eb621a2c669ac45b3cb7.jpg"},{"name":"Money itchy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/a7ab3a583b2d8942e1bc3d8183384b4066b9fada.jpg"},{"name":"A bit brutal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/b853e0d8a781f0f234b66ba7c8469c557fede554.jpg"},{"name":"B!R!U!T!A!L!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/01c105727cc2cfb8413c2fd3fb26f100ea13d714.jpg"},{"name":"Quick on feet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/8cca3fd2c9cba4ab8c3158e49ae56abfe476ed28.jpg"},{"name":"Five-finger discount","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/905f9137e33aeeab6a5298f008a07c2872d75203.jpg"},{"name":"Dripping gold","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/b702e4add1d419669cd86ce34defc3efc36e55e9.jpg"},{"name":" Water walker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/0e406b00d136d7149991d1a5154196736621a985.jpg"},{"name":"Secrets no more","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/575050/75c81b66e3f224d65ddb834169f1f9822e14b031.jpg"}],"total":34},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575050/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735119820","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575050/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735119820","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735119820","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/575050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735119820","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Add our new game to your wishlist!</h1><p></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Little Triangle has the most complete platformer experience among many others.
