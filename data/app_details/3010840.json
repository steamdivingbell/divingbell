{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Iota is beginning to lose their sense of who they are. Like the other members of their computer system, they have been locked away by the Corruption, a virus that spreads through subsystems, isolates the intelligent programs that operate them, and slowly erodes their memories.

You operate a repair core, which can navigate the system by ejecting between a variety of different hosts, each with their own dynamics and abilities. Some hosts are fixed in place, while others jump, slide, climb walls, or follow rails. To progress, it is often necessary to utilize several hosts in combination, taking advantage of each of their unique qualities and the rich interactions between them.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3010840/extras/Host_Demo.gif?t=1734119859\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Perhaps the most subtle yet versatile tool at your disposal is the ability to toggle a host to autopilot, locking in all current inputs to that host so that it will continue its present behavior, even if you eject away. In the hands of a seasoned technician, the repair core is an elegant tool, dancing fluidly between hosts to traverse damaged subsystems while gracefully evading security measures.
