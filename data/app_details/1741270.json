{"about_the_game":"Solomon Division is a 2 player online co-op psychological horror where you and your friend are employees of an agency that hunts demons breaching the border between our world and Hell. You are paranormal investigators and hunters who will enter haunted locations to find the type of the invading demon, find the object they possess, and banish him to Hell with a special ritual. Technicians will use your advanced equipment to search for the demon, and the Medium will banish the demon to Hell with her rituals. <br><br>You will choose one of the playable characters, playing either as a Technician or Medium each of whom have their own strengths and weaknesses. Technicians use their equipment to locate the room the demon is causing trouble in, while the Medium finds the name of the demon, and exorcises it. The demon gets more and more powerful the longer they remain in our world, so you have to be in haste, and prepare the ritual as soon as possible!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Co-op multiplayer: Play by yourself or alongside your friend in this co-op horror where teamwork is key to your success. It is a combination of co-op mechanics with intensity and addiction of horror games.<br></li><li>Core Gameplay: Incredible graphics on a level that is beyond the other games, and minimal user interface will keep your eyes open (or closed if you are a scaredy-cat). The core gameplay is based around searching and exorcising the scary supernatural being that haunts the place.<br></li><li>Unique Locations &amp; Demons: The creature, and location type is randomly generated in AAA quality. Three haunted locations that are familiar, but still scary, and over 5 different types of Demons all with unique names and requirements to banish them.<br></li><li>Investigate: Use your advanced equipment to gather evidence, and find the demon as soon as you can.<br></li><li>Full Voice Recognition: The Demons are listening! Use your actual voice to interact with the Demons.<br></li><li></li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1741270?t=1740205403","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1741270/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1740205403","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1741270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1740205403","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1741270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1740205403","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Solomon Division is a 2 player online co-op psychological horror where you and your friend are employees of an agency that hunts demons breaching the border between our world and Hell.
