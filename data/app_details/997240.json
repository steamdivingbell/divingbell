( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)[]  Siluman Fantasy. It is a nice adult RPG fantasy game made by Siluman Soft. At first glance, it looks like one of the more common games made with RPG maker tools. But this game is full of fairly hot stuffs![] And although this is an adult game, kindly, the player can decide for oneself whether the adult content option is on/off. ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)  Its game story features an adventure into another world that has been popular theme in Japan subculture. As Minoru you will experience a new world. It is where cute and lovely monster girls are. It feels like playing an adult game in lewd(\u2665)[] games. What will you be for these lovely monster girls? It's entirely up to you, hero! \u30fd(=\u00b4\u25bd`=)\uff89   Pros Un-Censored Funny Story Monster Girls Cons Rough Text Fonts Small Game Screen No Character Voice  *Conclusion:  Siluman Fantasy. This has potential as the first game made by Siluman Soft. Its gameplay is plain, text fonts are rough, but the story itself is humorous and fun. Above all, it is a positive thing to be able to meet attractive monster girls in Steam games. So, it's definitely worth playing! We look forward to their future projects too.

Siluman Fantasy wants to be the Dark Souls of eroRPGs, but it ends up just being the Lords of the Fallen.
