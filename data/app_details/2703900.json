{"about_the_game":"HEXAFLIP is a gripping strategy game that blends the classic sensibilities of tabletop strategy with the vibrant energy of a digital board game. Whether your prefer to outsmart other players in PvP skirmishes, or you like to obsess over optimal strategies in the campaign mode, this is a game for you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Mechanics</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Charge and Capacity</strong>. Each hexagon has a capacity (think of it as it's health), and charge. The charge represents the damage potential of a hexagon, or the number of nearby enemy hexagons it can zap.<br></li><li> <strong>Recharging</strong>. Using up charge makes the hexagons potentially less effective in future turns. But every time you use up all the charge on a hexagon, it triggers a recharge of all your hexagons. Plan your attacks wisely and create a satisfying recharge loop.<br></li><li> <strong>Special Abilities</strong>. Multiple special abilities are available (and more will be added). These abilities can spice up the dynamics in the game and take your plays to the next level! Special abilities require unstable charge to operate.<br></li><li> <strong>Unstable Charge</strong>. Unstable charge will gather on enemy hexagons. You need to zap the hexagons containing it to pick it up. At the end of each turn, the unstable charges migrate on the board challenging you to adapt on the spot.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Campaign</strong>: Single-player mode where you try to clear the map in as few turns as possible.<br></li><li> <strong>PVP</strong>: Play against other players on symmetrical maps.
