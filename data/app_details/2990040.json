{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore dungeons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight your way through the hordes of monsters emerging from the underground. Obligated with an almost impossible task, to eliminate this calamity, you have to descend into the catacombs of the desecrated temple. Your motivation? Getting your freedom back.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tailor your backpack</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not only the arrangement of items is crucial, but backpack parts itself as well! Tailor your backpack to your strategy, choosing which skills will ensure your survival. Unlock new backpack blocks and make your inventory even more powerful.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fight your way out to freedom\u00a0</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The dungeon is a dangerous place. Luckily you\u2019re a dangerous person also, with a whole arsenal of spells at hand. Choose your starting rune and come down to face the monsters. Earn experience with each horror fallen and pick new spells as you level up. Just mind your mana. You may be powerful, but magic is not an infinite resource.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Find magical artefacts</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Some unfortunate souls fell here before you, trying to remedy monster plague. Let's not their equipment go to waste. Pick up new items, when you defeat tougher enemies. Test new arrangements of the items to find the most lethal one, just be careful. Magical artefacts tend to interact with each other and sometimes create something even more dangerous.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Learn new skills</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Use experience earned with each descent to develop your skills in the skill tree. Contrary to popular belief, magic also requires a lot of stamina. And strength. And speed. And\u2026 You probably get it already.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990040/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1733919296","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990040/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1733919296","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990040/f7b2a38b5ddc6c72b8e0f24f43945b2cab91fa64/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733919296","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2990040/f7b2a38b5ddc6c72b8e0f24f43945b2cab91fa64/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733919296","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore dungeons</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fight your way through the hordes of monsters emerging from the underground.
