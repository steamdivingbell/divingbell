{"about_the_game":"In this first-person role-playing game, you play as Damitri (the lead character of the Spellbound book series). He shoots snowballs and icicles from his hand representing his ice magic abilities. The player has a companion, Laura. She has abilities relating to sound. She can scream to destroy enemies or sing to heal the player. Eventually, two more characters join the party. The pause menu is a 2D still image of the characters frozen in time. A character with abilities relating to time and space assists the player by pausing time, reversing time either back to the beginning of the level, or the entire game.<br />\r\nIn first person mode, the player will run as Damitri shooting as many snowballs and icicles at enemies such as zombies, mummies and possessed New Heat Guards. A character bio exists within the main menu. This gives is where most of the lore and backstories of the characters exist. <br />\r\nThere are two other game play modes. The player will have a third person view of a rock creature that the player can control. A second racing/chase level exists with the player controlling a vehicle powered by fire magic in third person mode.<br />\r\nOccasional cutscenes show the player's location and any bosses or obstacles that may exist in the scene.<br />\r\nSome levels prevent you from pausing. This is due to the person with time and space magic being incapable of assisting in these locations.<br />\r\nThe player can heal infinitely with the help of their companion. Although, a Game Over is very possible in areas of highly littered enemies.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2776560/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710785221","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2776560/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710785221","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2776560/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710785221","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2776560/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710785221","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"In this first-person role-playing game, you play as Damitri (the lead character of the Spellbound book series).
