{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 019 - August 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA! Inspired by old-school tabletop magazines, ARCADIA is MCDM's digital magazine for 5th edition GMs and players. We hope you like it! <br> <br><strong> Cursed Treasures</strong> by Jacky Leung with art from Grace Cheung. Surprise your players with three unique magic items that carry insidious curses, ways that stalwart adventurers can purge those curses, and guidance to create your own cursed items. The Boots of Tartarus let you walk across lava and travel into the Ethereal Plane, for the low, low price of possibly being trapped in a labyrinthine demiplane and hunted by chain devils. <br> <br><strong> Divine Trials: Shadows of the Moon</strong> by Amber Litke and Sadie Lowry with art from Zuzanna Wuzyk and cartography from Miska Fredman. This much-anticipated adventure is the second of three divine mini-dungeons to challenge prospective heroes--this time by making them confront their own fears, faults, and dark reflections. There are monsters lurking in the shadows of past regrets ... but those who triumph will emerge with newfound resolve and sagacity. <br> <br><strong> Break In Case of TPK</strong> by Justice Ramin Arman and Anthony Joyce-Rivera with art from Henrik Rosenborg. These four encounters make having a TPK sound like an unexpectedly good time! It's definitely a lifesaver (no pun intended) if the characters rush into a boss fight underprepared and get crushed. These encounters range from a fun get-out-of-dead-free card to a dubious deal--or desperate battle--with a cunning lich. &quot;","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469540/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1687267567","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469540/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1687267567","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469540/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1687267567","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2469540/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1687267567","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Arcadia Issue 019 - August 2022</h2>  Welcome to ARCADIA!
