{"about_the_game":"The soundtrack features a range of original music composed for the game: Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga by the game's lead developer Phil Hamilton via digital orchestra. The writing takes its inspiration largely from Hitoshi Sakimoto's various works for RPGs and strategy games. There are several different styles included in addition to the classical fantasy themes, such as the soaring guitar melody of the Arena battle theme, to the exotic orchestration of the desert mission themes, and more.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1977690/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1717428803","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1977690/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1717428803","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1977690/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1717428803","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1977690/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1717428803","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The soundtrack features a range of original music composed for the game: Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga by the game's lead developer Phil Hamilton via digital orchestra.
