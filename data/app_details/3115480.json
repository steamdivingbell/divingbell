{"about_the_game":"Enter a dark and vague world, with danger lurking behind every corner and horrific foes withering under the scorched Sun. You play as a Tethered, one of many born from clay and dirt with a weapon bound to your soul, and you must adapt, salvage and strengthen your destructive powers to slay all that stands in your way. With strategic turn based combat and a free roam dungeon crawl experience, every decision you make will pave the path forward.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3115480/extras/SteamBanner2.png?t=1722116637\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Strategic and deep turn based grid based combat</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Powerful builds and gear combinations using Binds to augment your Weapons on a turn by turn basis</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full 3D movement, capturing the feel and depth of old school dungeon crawlers with the modern convenience of controls in games today</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A cruel but beautiful world with environmental story telling</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3115480/extras/SteamBanner1.png?t=1722116637\" /><br><br>In Diviner, you are only as strong as your understanding of your tools.
