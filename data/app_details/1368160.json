Gone are the days of dragging boxes on the battlefield, instead you control entire formations or all the workers at a specific base with a single click. Give your fighting formations special commands depending on the situation, or use your spellcasters to turn the tide of epic battles. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/headline2-basemanage.png?t=1737980253\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/SteamWorker.gif?t=1737980253\" />Build up to 40 distinctive buildings, from barracks to research laboratories, siege workshops, and air academies to transportation portals.

They have access to a wide range of spells, including attacking, defending and strengthing the base mining. How you control and manage your Seneer can be pivotal to your success in a mission. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each mage allows you to specialise in one or more schools of magic during a mission. Magic schools currently have four levels. The highest level unlocks the most powerful spells and research for that school.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/headline2-strategy.png?t=1737980253\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1368160/extras/SteamStrategy.gif?t=1737980253\" />Play at your own pace, stop the game anytime and think about your decisions. Manage your large army and its formation, select which unit and building types to attack, set &quot;flee&quot; parameters on the attack, or recall your troops when the battle seems lost.
