All that is recovered from the scene is the last recording on the camera found deep within the catacombs. Now you will have to relive the persons experience through the recording itself. See if you can alter the outcome, unravel the mystery of the depths of the catacombs and ultimately change their fate for survival or sudden demise. You play as the person who dropped the camera and ran away during the last moments of footage in the lost tape. The Paris Catacombs are filled with many historical monuments, more than 6 million bones of the dead from overfilled graveyards and the black plague dating back to the 18th and the mid 19th century.
