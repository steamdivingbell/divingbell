The game includes mild fantasy violence where players engage in battles against mystical creatures and enemies using swords and magical abilities. There is no graphic depiction of gore, but combat scenes may involve stylized, cartoon-like violence.\r\n\r\nThe game also touches on darker themes, including a sombre atmosphere, moments of psychological tension, and the presence of supernatural elements. These themes are intended to enhance the narrative experience but are presented without explicit or realistic depictions of violence or horror.\r\n\r\nThere is no sexual content, nudity, or depiction of drug and alcohol use in the game. However, players should be aware of the mature narrative themes of heroism, sacrifice, and confronting inner fears within a fantastical setting."},"detailed_description":"<strong>Overview:</strong><br><br><i>Lone Howl</i> is a rogue-like survival game where you take on the role of a fierce one-eyed wolf, facing endless waves of relentless enemies.
