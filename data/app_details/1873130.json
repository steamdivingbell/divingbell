{"about_the_game":"Blown away is a singleplayer explorer game filled with puzzles, obstacles and hidden locations. The game takes place in a civilization called Yhorba influenced by bubbles. One day the machine that provides the protective bubble around the island breaks down. This caused the island to fall down and crash on the abandoned planet underneath. Your goal is to repair the machine to restore the protective bubble. To do so you must find the mechanical parts that are scattered around the abandoned planet. By solving puzzles, overcoming obstacles and explore hidden areas, the main character can locate these mechanical parts.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Meet Mylo!</strong><br>Mylo is our hero, he is the engineer of the city.
