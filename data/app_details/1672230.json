{"about_the_game":"In Pogo Rocket, you take the role of a new employee who's job is to control a new experimental rocket. With aliens harvesting the Earth's resources, your only method of travel is via pogo stick. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you spring your way through various retro futuristic environments, you'll need to dodge all sorts of obstacles and dangers like turrets, lasers, and life-sucking orbs! Utilize collectable repairs, bouncy surfaces, and rotating platforms to your advantage. If all that isn't enough for you, browse through a plethora of different modifiers that change your game experience in new and creative ways. Each one modifies your score at the end of a level for a fresh new take on each level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake advantage of multiple upgrades that can change the way in which you tackle each level. Take on two different bosses and destroy them in order to progress. You don't have to tackle it all alone either. Play locally or through Remote Play with up to 4 players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're feeling a little more creative, then browse the Workshop for user created levels, or make your own and upload them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n Can you beat every level and save the world?","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Dedicated Employee","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/71cbed9b360c2edbf64659650e0de14324758646.jpg"},{"name":"From Beyond the Grave","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/f07e79a71ebcdca7076a538629067f27062de926.jpg"},{"name":"Training Complete","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/e083ee68662abea56343b256a0c82263df03f9c0.jpg"},{"name":"Just a Scratch","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/9cc34e5cff5c877b4ee48cf0997e8acf223835a6.jpg"},{"name":"A Deeper Scratch","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/679605832c7e8224a968c16f74fe2776459bb8ea.jpg"},{"name":"Engineer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/36bd028c3636c56bac10c6273fac29b81396d839.jpg"},{"name":"Speed Demon","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/2db2b22b0759ea258285c4640f512d8a65216647.jpg"},{"name":"Jumpscare","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/9c03f5d7f601e6f30662b2f3fc1acd4f5d6511c0.jpg"},{"name":"Working Out The Kinks","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/fedd05d603a3220a33bce4baa266193702468347.jpg"},{"name":"Block Game","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1672230/9f9e7d6162a6652c15641b55a48b1f3d6e021d6a.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1684351857","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672230/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1684351857","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1684351857","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1672230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1684351857","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In Pogo Rocket, you take the role of a new employee who's job is to control a new experimental rocket.
