However, he finds himself in a real-life horror scenario as he becomes the target of a 10-foot-tall maniac known as the Abattoir Man.<br><br><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>In the game, players can choose to play either as Michael D'Amato, the victim, or as Trevor Hartman, the Abattoir Man himself. If playing as Michael, the goal is to run, hide, set traps, solve puzzles, and collect four keys needed to escape. The game is designed to be tense and scary while also incorporating humor, creating a unique experience that doesn't take itself too seriously but still aims to instill a sense of dread and terror.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020780/extras/ezgif-1-56e77c1005.gif?t=1736402137\" /><br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br>- The game allows you to play as two characters: Michael D'Amato, the victim, or Trevor Hartman, the Abattoir Man.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020780/extras/ezgif-1-e454ce2965.gif?t=1736402137\" /><br><br>- The graphics are inspired by anime and the look of old 80s MS-DOS and Commodore 64 games, giving it a nice retro style charm.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020780/extras/Michael_D_Amato2.png?t=1736402137\" /><br><br>- The game features multiple endings, encouraging replayability.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3020780/extras/3-7587fhxa.png?t=1736402137\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"What Will Be Left of Them?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/8d880407fbe3ea790a3bcf12104b79ebfb20e61c.jpg"},{"name":"The Best There Ever Was!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/f0ff7b86e3d83d9e410e43cba571dcbcc67a5d6d.jpg"},{"name":"Demon Saviour","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/7b467f425536d4cdf62baf2810835588c2de84bf.jpg"},{"name":"THINK, JOE!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/2f0cce8f72421582dcd3192999a39e3d1b3750ac.jpg"},{"name":"Terrible Fate","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/b017c5f00ff9606dc2b35f89ce1938e60585cb75.jpg"},{"name":"Fly Away","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/c830beb81fe113658cdfe49fe8381d480cee622b.jpg"},{"name":"Damn Rats...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/fb0d47ddf978f19ef0884bffc65e4276fe46030a.jpg"},{"name":"Tribute?!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3020780/3fdb1001692707161e7a42eb5559580bf2dcb2ce.jpg"},{"name":"Where Are You Going?
