{"about_the_game":"Alborada is a cross-platform idle game &amp; audio player that runs on Linux, Windows and Android devices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game:</h2><br>Enter the forest to get familiar with the flora, and discover new plants, mushrooms and trees. Resolve simple puzzles to unlock new plants and customize your forest. Play with the time and weather to adjust your ideal atmosphere to focus on your tasks or just relax and meditate with the sounds of nature.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Field recording library:</h2><br>The field recording library is an ongoing project of sound recordings from the different parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Enjoy the meadows, forests, lakes, rivers and other natural sounds anywhere you go just by playing the game or running the software in an Audio Player mode. The field recording library contains sounds of:<br><br>-\tForests: day and night<br>-\tMeadows: day and night<br>-\tLakes: day and night<br>-\tRivers: soft and medium loudness<br>-\tMountain\u2019s wind: soft and medium loudness<br>-\tRain: soft and medium loudness, thunder <br>-\tSwamps: in future releases<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Audio Player:</h2><br>Choose the Audio Player mode if you just want to enjoy the recording while saving some battery, even though both Game and Audio Player modes play the same recording, the Audio Player is more flexible and much lighter as it doesn\u2019t need to load any game objects to run and does not depend on the weather and time conditions of the game to play the sounds, allowing the user to roam freely through the library.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Music:</h2><br>Enjoy original late romantic style themes and motives accompanying the nature recordings at specific events or moments through the game or just by picking the track on the Audio Player.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About me:</h2><br>My name is Eugeni, I\u00b4m a software developer, music composer and field recording enthusiast from Spain and I\u00b4m happy to bring you a project that combines all my passions. Even though Alborada was made as a solo project I will be happy to collaborate with other musicians &amp; artists to enrich the overall experience of the game. Lastly, I\u00b4d like to add that the audio library will be periodically updated not just with the sounds from the Iberian Peninsula but also from other places as long as I\u00b4m able to keep recording during my free time.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2566370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1694458008","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2566370/page.bg.jpg?t=1694458008","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2566370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1694458008","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2566370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1694458008","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Alborada is a cross-platform idle game &amp; audio player that runs on Linux, Windows and Android devices.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game:</h2><br>Enter the forest to get familiar with the flora, and discover new plants, mushrooms and trees.
