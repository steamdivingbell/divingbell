{"about_the_game":"Sorrow Asylum is a looping horror game, a mix of an abandoned asylum and your mind's prison. The longer you stay, the deeper you sink.<br />\r\nExplore the asylum of sadness, where time stops, unless you progress by taking the calendar pages into your room down in the basement of the asylum. The longer you stay in this place, the more horrors will try and stop you, fix you, change you, the more the whole place gets affected by your presence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is an atmospheric surreal horror experience, this time showing you the story of the Plague Doctor and his painful past. You will also meet a new character Vanessa, a new creature Lunar and Dalu makes a return as well. Many things in the game will be up to your interpretation, but this surrealism is also tied with survival, as you will need to run and escape from the creatures, or find ways to keep going in this story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game has 15 day cycles to offer, where the asylum gets progressively more and more sinister and dangerous.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Maybe... Maybe you'll make it through. As you chose to suffer through all the pain, maybe in the end there is something waiting for you.&quot;","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Sorrow Death","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3084670/250a292e646b9638a36884bdb0cf337525957935.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1721389746","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084670/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1721389746","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084670/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1721389746","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3084670/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1721389746","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"The game features fear, horror, themes of violence and death."},"detailed_description":"Sorrow Asylum is a looping horror game, a mix of an abandoned asylum and your mind's prison.
