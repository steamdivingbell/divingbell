A world not unlike our own yet somewhat alien to us. <br>Chesnakisnak is a short choose-your-own adventure game which takes place in New Estuary city, in an anachronistic 1939. <br>You play as Artorious Manx, proprietor of Chesnakisnak, a bar/snack shop selling fried garlic bread to the people of New Estuary. <br>Artorious returns home every day to read his mail on his brand new Calculator. How he responds to this mail changes Artorious' story- will he miss paying his rent or perhaps find that the flames of lust have been lit between him and a childhood friend?  <br>Relax and take in the sights or listen to DJ Laytnyt spin the best tunes on NEFM, all night long. Play various mini-games and explore your apartment building or read news articles on your Calculator.  <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/extras/G2.gif?t=1666991569\" /><br>The night is young still. <br>New Estuary awaits. <br>You're never alone.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/extras/G3.gif?t=1666991569\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Leona Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Clarissa Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Ionia Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Tivia Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Warwick Ending","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"All Endings","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"VIP","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Whipper Button","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Milk of Oxides","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"},{"name":"Touchdown!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1433770/1e2500c39f21dc28da5044d6339808870cf6cd2e.jpg"}],"total":31},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1666991569","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/page.bg.jpg?t=1666991569","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1666991569","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1666991569","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1433770/extras/G1.gif?t=1666991569\" /><br>What if we saw a glimpse of a world alien to us, a dimension where we had conquered space yet never discovered the concept of the movable typing press?<br>Or what if we saw a world where Cathode-ray tube TV's exist alongside mobile phones and swing music?
