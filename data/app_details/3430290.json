{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Start from nothing and build your empire in the concrete jungle of New York City. Begin your journey as a street-smart entrepreneur with nothing but ambition and hustle. Take on odd jobs, work the streets, and do whatever it takes to stack those dollars. A true hustler knows every opportunity is a chance to climb higher. Master the art of the deal while navigating the relentless pace of NYC.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your path begins in the roughest neighborhoods, where every dollar counts. Start small - reselling items or running legitimate errands for busy professionals. As your reputation grows, so do your opportunities. Build connections in different boroughs and expand your network from local streets to corporate offices. Remember, in this city, it's not just what you know - it's who you know.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Time management is crucial in the life of a hustler. Monitor your basic needs like sleep, nutrition, and most importantly - stress levels. The city never sleeps, but you need to. Keep an eye on your stress meter; too much pressure can ruin the biggest deals. Take breaks to recharge with a smoke or vape, but remember - balance is key. A burnt-out hustler is no good to anyone.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Learn to read the streets and spot opportunities others miss. Different neighborhoods offer different potential - what works in Brooklyn might not fly in Manhattan. Start in the rougher areas where competition is fierce but entry costs are low. As you build your bank, expand into middle-class neighborhoods with more sophisticated ventures. Eventually, take your business acumen to the premium districts where the real money flows.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Property is power in New York City. Start by renting a modest spot in a developing area, then work your way up to owning prime real estate. Each property you acquire opens new possibilities - from local convenience stores to high-end boutiques. Transform run-down buildings into thriving businesses. Your empire can span from corner shops in the Bronx to luxury penthouses in Manhattan.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The city is your playground, and every interaction is an opportunity. Build relationships with local business owners, negotiate better deals with suppliers, and learn when to partner up or compete. As your influence grows, so do the stakes. Graduate from neighborhood ventures to citywide operations, and eventually, take your business international. In Hustler Simulator, your rise from street-level entrepreneur to business mogul is limited only by your ambition and smarts.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3430290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737398410","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3430290/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737398410","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3430290/e5214491b647f87ccdd00c154d62b4afe29e5dbd/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737398410","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3430290/e5214491b647f87ccdd00c154d62b4afe29e5dbd/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737398410","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Start from nothing and build your empire in the concrete jungle of New York City.
