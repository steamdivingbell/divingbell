{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270410/extras/Logo750x180.png?t=1702098350\" /><br>Farmburgh is a re-imagining of the classic browser point and click idle farming games (you know which ones I'm talking about). Many of those games have since fizzled out or have been converted to mobile cash grabs. Farmburgh dares to be a breath of fresh air on the genre. You can decorate your farm, plant many various crops, raise (sometimes wacky) animals and craft trade goods to sell for a profit. Farmburgh has a little for everyone, from the hardcore optimizer, squeezing every last drop of profit out of their farm to the artistic person, creating a beautiful home for their animals. Whatever your style, come on down to Farmburgh and become the virtual farmer you were always meant to be.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270410/extras/AboutCrop.png?t=1702098350\" /><br>What would a farming game be without farming? Plow your fields and plant your crops with just a couple of clicks. Each plant takes a designated real life time to grow, from minutes to hours. Plant a few rows of corn on your lunch break and come back after work to harvest them. All the plants are always in season in Farmburgh, so you have many to choose from. Each one with their own advantages and disadvantages. Be sure to check in often, especially around holidays. The store is known to stock up on special crops during those times.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270410/extras/AboutAnimal.png?t=1702098350\" /><br>Animals have their place on the farm too! Don't worry though, Farmburgh is a strictly no-kill district. That means you have to come up with some creative ways to gather resources from your animals. We won't tell you what those are yet...that's up to you to see for yourself! Animal's produce a resource every few minutes to every few hours once they reach adulthood. This game never takes itself too seriously. So you may have some exotic animals along side your cows and sheep.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270410/extras/AboutCrafting.png?t=1702098350\" /><br>Now you've got plenty of produce and plenty of animal products, so now what? You could sell them like that or combine your different resources to make even more money. Some buildings have an option to purchase crafting stations in them. These crafting stations allow you to combine resources to make food, alcohol, textiles and other trade good. Once you set recipe, it'll continue crafting until you tell it to stop or it runs out of ingredients. Just like crop and animals, crafting takes a designated amount of real life time to do. This may take longer than selling directly, but I promise the payoff will be worth it!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270410/extras/AboutMarketplace.png?t=1702098350\" /><br>After all that hard work, it's time to get paid. You're able to sell your goods to various marketplaces. Each marketplace requires a one time purchase in order to use them. They each also have products that sell at a higher or lower price than normal. For instance, you can't sell your homemade vodka at a school bake sale and your knitted sweater wouldn't do well at a winery. You start off with your roadside stand, making minimal profits. Eventually you can work your way up!<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2270410/extras/AboutDecor.png?t=1702098350\" /><br>So you've got tons of cash now, what's next? Decorate your farm with tons of decorations from the catalog. Fences, benches, flags, trees and so much more. New decor is being added all the time.
