{"about_the_game":"An exciting intellectual fishing game for one or more players, where as a \u201cfish\u201d you need to catch words divided into two parts. Each player gets control of a boat and a fishing rod, with which they need to catch as many fish as possible. Each fish carries only one of the two parts of a word. For example, the word \u201cgame\u201d will be divided into two fish \u201cig\u201d and \u201cra\u201d. Whoever catches both of these syllables will collect the word \u201cgame\u201d. Whichever player caught the most words in a certain time won!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout the game<br />\r\nSimple rules: each player can either move left and right (to determine where to cast the fishing rod), or lower and raise the fishing rod. To catch a fish, you just need to \u201chook\u201d it with a hook. To catch a word, you need to catch two fish - parts of this word.<br />\r\nThere is a mode for 1 player (catch as many word fish as possible against time and earn more coins).<br />\r\nThere is a mode for several (2-4) players on one screen (have time to catch more fish than your friends).<br />\r\nSupport for Russian and English languages (both in the interface and in gameplay).<br />\r\nThere are 2 difficulty levels for each language (the difficulty level affects the number and complexity of words; even preschoolers know words at an easy level)<br />\r\nThere are 9 fisherman characters to choose from.<br />\r\nAt the end of each round, each player receives a prize - coins (as many coins as he managed to catch the words).<br />\r\nThere is a store where you can spend the coins you earn and buy cool nautical jewelry.<br />\r\nTimed game.<br />\r\nThe game uses cute cartoon graphics.<br />\r\nThe game has beautiful special effects and pleasant music!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999230/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1718351028","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999230/page.bg.jpg?t=1718351028","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999230/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1718351028","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2999230/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1718351028","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"An exciting intellectual fishing game for one or more players, where as a \u201cfish\u201d you need to catch words divided into two parts.
