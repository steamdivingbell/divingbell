{"about_the_game":"In TIMEWINDER you can travel back in time to solve the puzzle and precision platforming challenges in a unique way. Use the simple and intuitive controls to progress through three diverse chapters, overcoming every obstacle in your path. Traveling back in time is not without consequences though, if you move the wrong item or interact with the previous version of yourself you will break the timeline continuity and need to start over!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The question is not how, but when</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745600/extras/timetravel-demo.gif?t=1712935772\" /><br>If something is impossible now, that doesn't mean it always has been: sometimes you don't need to jump higher or run faster but see the problem in a new perspective. Travel back in time and add a new dimension to your problem-solving skills. Whether there are doors opening and closing or platforms moving away and towards you, traveling back in time at the approppriate moments will always offer a way forward.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745600/extras/timetravel-warning.gif?t=1712935772\" /><br>Be careful however. Time is powerful, and when meddled with, dangerous. Breaking the timeline continuity is just as dangerous as the spiky crystals found throughout the levels: you can go back in time but not change your own history. If you used a platform to jump higher and then move that platform away, or close a door you already entered (or will enter, it's all a matter of perspective) the timeline continuity will be broken and you will need to try again in a different way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">There's always another secret</h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2745600/extras/bonus-example.png?t=1712935772\" /><br>Traveling back in time to before you completed this game is sadly not possible, but after completion of all of the levels there is still enough to do.
