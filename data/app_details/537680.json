{"about_the_game":"Sheep Tag 2 is a competitive, fast paced, action packed tag game that pits Sheep against Wolves. It's a constant battle for territory as Sheep must survive for a set time, and Wolves must capture all the Sheep within that time. As Sheep you are constantly putting your life at risk to gain the edge over the Wolves, and as Wolves you are thinking of ways to outwit and capture the Sheep. If a Sheep is captured they turn into a Spirit; Spirits can be saved by ally Sheep. If all the Sheep get captured the Wolves win the round!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Online multiplayer.</strong> Up to 16 players per lobby.<br></li><li><strong>Asymmetric teams.</strong> Enjoy distinct gaming experiences as either Sheep or Wolf.<br></li><li><strong>Infinite replayability.</strong> Not a single match will ever be the same.<br></li><li><strong>RTS and MOBA elements.</strong> Enjoy a mix of base building, resource gathering, and intense micro. <br></li><li><strong>High skill ceiling.</strong> Spend hours mastering the mechanics and physics of the world.<br></li><li><strong>Heart pounding moments.</strong> The pressure is on as both Sheep and Wolves race against the clock.<br></li><li><strong>Level editing.</strong> Create your own maps to play and share with friends.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/537680/extras/SheepTopHat.gif?t=1726255065\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">History</h2>Created long before other popular mods, Sheep Tag has deep roots in Warcraft 3 going back over 20 years.
