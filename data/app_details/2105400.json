{"about_the_game":"Mad scientists have released ungodly abominations from their testing facilities. A security guard put on ice, only to be thawed in case of EXTREME emergency, you wake up with one thought in mind........killing. <br><br>With the help of a tech expert, Art, you need to make your way through this lab from the pits of hell and put a stop to these monsters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CLASSIC FPS CONTROLS</h2>Looking up is overrated anyways. If you are here for a classic FPS feel, you're in the right hands. Don't worry, we took all the feel of a classic Boomer Shooter and jammed packed it with the speed and high paced gameplay of modern shooters. It's a Frankenstein and you'll love it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FULL ARSENAL</h2>Six weapons with dramatically different mechanics. Wanna shoot grapple lasers? Got it! Wanna unload a full mag into some eyeball? Got that too! What about a tried and true shotgun? Oh you know we wouldn't leave that out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THREE GRUSOME ACTS</h2>Kick monster ass through three acts, 15 levels, and 3 unique bosses. There is something not right on in this testing facility, will you get to the bottom of it? Who cares, you're here to leave a pile of bodies on your way out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHALLENGE MODE</h2>Test your weapon mastery in a challenge mode. Race against the clock to beat a procedurally generated set of 5 levels with endless combinations. Did I mention, you only get 1 weapon.....good luck.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Only The Beginning","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/0b87cdd32bd9e17d805ba3e1bdd3a72dd24a85f0.jpg"},{"name":"Crushed 'em Like a Bug","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/701604510ab9dbe9734d8f06a6797b6bb1ae528d.jpg"},{"name":"In this world, there is no God.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/9bed6526800a0000d4749e1cdafd0faff98781c0.jpg"},{"name":"Challenge Complete ","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/6bf8dec7ef6c43588d46103c82f3c9f21097aef0.jpg"},{"name":"Shields Up!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/9ab9b8a56de392599794effe1c1503416dc2ee6e.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/ed2a595961f8571f4b8d9f70fbf1591e283a8d67.jpg"},{"name":"Arsenal Acquired","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/e1d7af063741343dbbfea9e9549642312d3b0f9c.jpg"},{"name":"Faster than Light","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/4d7a177b379f479edf21a2a10af5ba81749468ee.jpg"},{"name":"Goodbye Art.","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2105400/1d52e4f0316302e0fc22f8306bac5d7afc04d8e1.jpg"}],"total":9},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1664578883","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105400/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1664578883","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1664578883","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2105400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1664578883","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"Game contains violence."},"detailed_description":"Mad scientists have released ungodly abominations from their testing facilities.
