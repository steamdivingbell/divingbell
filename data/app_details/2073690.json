I believed that strong game mechanics with free to play model would make the low-quality models/animations acceptable. As a programmer, I was too focused on what players can do in my game, but the art style is also a very important part of the game. Art style is what separates the gaming world from the real world. A part of me knew it, but instead of giving equal attention to both art and game mechanics, I picked game mechanics (which is not right). \r\nI realized my mistake, now what should I do now? Well, action speaks louder than word. So I spend more time and remodeled weapons, and characters. Instead of using shiny colors in maps, I used actual light. I reanimated and took extra steps to make animations more natural. There are more particle and VFX effects. More props across the map. \r\nSo, what's next? Obviously, I will continue to apply the lesson I learned in the development cycle. On the other side, I will try to expand my team.\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n-Nahian Sharif\r\nDeveloper and captain of Smily Pirates</p><br><h1>About the Demo</h1>REmatch is an RPG game with a spooky, puzzle based, combat system.
