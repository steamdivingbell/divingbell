The battles take place from a third-person perspective and involve the use of various futuristic weapons and technology to destroy enemies. Violent scenes are frequent, with combat moments where robots are dismantled or explode upon taking damage.\r\n\r\nAlthough no humans or animals are involved in the combat, the visual presentation of robot destruction can be intense, with special effects such as sparks, explosions, and debris. There is no blood or human injury depicted, but the emphasis is on fast-paced and challenging action, where precision and tactics are required to progress.\r\n\r\n**Other notes:**\r\n\r\n- There are no sexual themes or depictions in the game.\r\n- There are no explicit references to drug use, alcohol abuse, or self-harm.\r\n- The game does not contain depictions of assault, non-consensual sex, or other potentially sensitive subjects.\r\n- The focus is purely on strategic combat against mechanical enemies within a science fiction setting."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"In this scifi third person action-adventure game you are a Protector taking the control over MechaNest back.<br />\r\nFind your way true mazes, farm Mechaparts, craft keys and weapons, vehicles and upgrades.<br />\r\nUnlock and use the special transportation tubes across the world.<br />\r\nEarn reputation with the Mecha citizens so that we can find the balance again between the Mechs and Humans.","developers":["PhilBerex"],"genres":[{"description":"Action","id":"1"},{"description":"Adventure","id":"25"},{"description":"Indie","id":"23"},{"description":"RPG","id":"3"}],"header_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/header.jpg?t=1739029416","is_free":false,"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"></ul>"},"name":"MechaNest","package_groups":[],"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>VR Support:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> TBD</li></ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>VR Support:</strong> TBD<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> TBD</li></ul>"},"platforms":{"linux":false,"mac":false,"windows":true},"publishers":["Xloron"],"ratings":{"dejus":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Viol\u00eancia","rating":"10","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"10","use_age_gate":"0"},"steam_germany":{"banned":"0","descriptors":"Gewalt","rating":"12","rating_generated":"1","required_age":"12","use_age_gate":"0"}},"release_date":{"coming_soon":true,"date":"Coming soon"},"required_age":0,"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/ss_e03e25f6494a10568ea4b152abc3bde180c668f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739029416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/ss_e03e25f6494a10568ea4b152abc3bde180c668f8.600x338.jpg?t=1739029416"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/ss_1a3bf59345eb8639e7dcc35a17b8a9a471b3864f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739029416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/ss_1a3bf59345eb8639e7dcc35a17b8a9a471b3864f.600x338.jpg?t=1739029416"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/ss_8ec9bbe72446d2bb6d3b1bce093ad345fcd633fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1739029416","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1585200/ss_8ec9bbe72446d2bb6d3b1bce093ad345fcd633fa.600x338.jpg?t=1739029416"}],"short_description":"Explore Scifi third person action-adventure game MechaNest.
