No more myths were left for him to hunt. His kills turned ritualistic, more dangerous. He tracked narwhals, sheared their horns and used them to impale polar bears. He ripped anacondas in half above ceremonial bonfires. He gutted wolves, hauled the carcasses up mountains, laid them in pentagrams to summon greater prey. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each occult killing gave him visions which led him south. There he found tracks of creatures that were tremendous. The air around them was poisoned with the stench of evil and spoiled meat. Fishermen spoke of haunting screams and screeches that filled the night. Skull Taker stalked the outcasts who entered these grounds. He overheard stories about a prehistoric alligator that roiled with tar and lightning. There were mutterings of a spider large enough to kill buffalo and demons that summoned fire.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Eventually, Skull Taker trapped one of these Hunters. He stole the ritual injection that gave him access to a never-ending source of prey. A festering paradise he could call home awaited him. </p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3204810?t=1732201167","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3204810?t=1732201167","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204810/c8005fabe08de4abaf40600dc6418114f8a7a680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732201167","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3204810/c8005fabe08de4abaf40600dc6418114f8a7a680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732201167","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The DLC itself does not contain mature content, but please be aware that Hunt: Showdown 1896 has depictions of violence during gameplay."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Skull Taker (Hunter) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Hidden Strike (Krag Sniper) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Liar\u2019s Bite (Sparks Pistol) </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">- Snake in the Grass (Bear Trap)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><u><strong>Skull Taker</strong></u></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Skull Taker is fueled by a primal pride.
