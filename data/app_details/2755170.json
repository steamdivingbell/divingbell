Apparently...</h2>Our first character is Max, the protagonist and the quintessential lazy prince, especially when it comes to royal responsibilities! Indeed, he never misses a chance to grab a good pint with some friends. His laziness and indifference have made him a magnet for problems. Lady Luck doesn't seem to be on his side, but he's doing his best to change her mind... Maybe...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Karen - Leaf her alone!</h2>The demonic realm, as the name suggests, is chock-full of demons with a colorful array of behaviors. That's why Karen, who is also very shy, has some trouble relating to them and prefers the company of plants, which certainly don't have as &quot;lively&quot; of a personality as the other living beings of those lands. However, she's unexpectedly stubborn and resolute in her beliefs, so don't underestimate her!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lilith - She's a real bombshell!</h2>Among all types of demons, archdevils stand out as some of the most powerful, and Lilith is one of them. As the throne\u2019s heir, she might seem haughty and distant, with her social skills certainly not helping much.. In reality, she loves to help those in need and can't stand to see someone in trouble. She just has one small flaw: she can't control her emotions well, so it's better to be careful about what you say around her, she might &quot;explode&quot; at any moment!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Aurelia - NOT Lilith</h2>Sure, there are plenty of bizarre creatures, but Aurelia might just top them all. Before you even think it, no, she's not some kind of Lilith\u2019s knock-off. And don't you dare say that to her face; she can be as nasty as she wants to be. But don't worry, you'll have enough time to dig through her snarky comments and her good-girl facade to see what lies beneath those tough layers, that is if you manage to survive the ordeal.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2755170/extras/LAD-FEAT.png?t=1736088905\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Here are the awesome features inside Love and Demons:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Look Max, one day all of this will be yours. </strong>Have fun discovering and exploring the world's variety and the beauty of its characters.
