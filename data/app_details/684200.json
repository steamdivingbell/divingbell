{"about_the_game":"<strong><strong>Icons: Legacy Edition</strong> is a Tribute Release to the Wavedash Team and the fans of the free-to-play game, Icons: Combat Arena</strong><br><br>Note: This game is considered final and should not be intended to have additional updates besides critical bug fixes.<br><br><strong>About Icons: Combat Arena:</strong><br><br>Icons: Combat Arena was a free-to-play platform fighting game designed by hardcore fans to be a love letter to the genre. The goal was to take the most beloved characters and competitive elements of franchise platform fighting games and distribute them for free on PC so anyone, anywhere could enjoy them online. <br><br>Fans of platform fighting games will feel right at home with elements of Icons: Combat Arena's roster with a space animal, sword fighter, rushdown brawler and grappler. Mixing in a bit of their own flavor, Icons: Combat Arena adds new, unexplored character designs:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A gunslinger with the ability to ricochet bullets off platforms and stages<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/684200/extras/raymer.png?t=1646693183\" /><br></li><li>A gruesome guan dao-slinging warrior with the ability to withstand any attack<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/684200/extras/weishan.jpg?t=1646693183\" /><br></li><li>A pair of statues that can switch places with one another to surprise opponents, and<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/684200/extras/afigalu.jpg?t=1646693183\" /><br></li><li>A girl witch who seals demons into her weapons and can freely fly around the stage on her broom</li></ul><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/684200/extras/ezzie.jpg?t=1646693183\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legacy Edition - Key Improvements:</h2><br>Once it was apparent that the studio would not be able to sustain operations, the Wavedash team spent their final weeks doing their best to resolve as many of the fan-requested changes as possible. The goal for Legacy Edition was to resolve clear issues with Icon's original monetization, input delay and region-locking as well as provide fun tweaks to character movesets and balance that they thought the community would enjoy.  Now, more than a year after their shutdown, Icons: Legacy Edition will finally see the light of day.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>An Entire Free-to-Play Game's Worth of Content:</strong> Legacy Edition includes all eight characters, dozens of costumes for each character, customizable voice and taunts as well as a slew of holograms for emoting mid-match!<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/684200/extras/2.jpg?t=1646693183\" /><br></li><li><strong>Global, Peer-to-Peer, Online Connectivity:</strong> The netcode was refactored to peer-to-peer connections.
