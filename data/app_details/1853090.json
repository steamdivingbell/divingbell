But apart from that, he was an intelligent, funny and kind person that really had a special gift to make everyone feel appreciated and included. The Evonescent indie game studio was founded a few weeks after Jonas's passing and is entirely due to that tragic event. The name &quot;Evonescent&quot; comes from evolution and evanescent, and for which the concept was&quot; The Evolution of everything that fades away&quot;. By making this game, we pay tribute to Jonas, whom we loved. We really hope that Axiallis will be able to play a small part in keeping the memory of Jonas Neubauer alive. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/extras/axiallis-gameplay3.gif?t=1651935178\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Level 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/9ef667332ac4fe217e3d4652cad2f68d74119b3e.jpg"},{"name":"Level 3","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/4ceab6ff8dbc5ba93f638e98f6804103ee77b5db.jpg"},{"name":"Level 4","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/c1dd2e3b83a5049470c8d86866f88ef768487709.jpg"},{"name":"Level 5","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/c3abed704889459570686aa7c89b0ab38c5c7faa.jpg"},{"name":"Level 6","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/0458cc333c8556b8597b5a5e5bd686529eef4eeb.jpg"},{"name":"Level 7","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/93461f738aeaf44201b048c9c6143e87680ece45.jpg"},{"name":"Pieces Rank S","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/c736959c71e88389cf08f2f90282f8d3b90bdfd5.jpg"},{"name":"Lines Rank S","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/ffaaf6ff282ac2ec4453d4fc80a485143a22956e.jpg"},{"name":"Axis Rank S","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/10e78237d568b7ce128703c4b28ff99f1f400b78.jpg"},{"name":"Axiallis Rank S","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1853090/2b3b8b187e9e9e78bdd77714f4d9104625b8c9d8.jpg"}],"total":32},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1651935178","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/page.bg.jpg?t=1651935178","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1651935178","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1651935178","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"This game contains swear words and references to drugs"},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/extras/time-to-stack.png?t=1651935178\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1853090/extras/axiallis-gameplay1.gif?t=1651935178\" /><br><br>Don\u2019t let the look of this game deceive you, it might look similar to Tetris, but it doesn\u2019t play like Tetris.
