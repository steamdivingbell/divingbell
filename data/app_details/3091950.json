{"about_the_game":"Do you also spend Sunday mornings doing household chores? In my case, I follow this rule to the letter. Every Sunday. Without exception. Well... I should be cleaning today, but here I am, writing this...<br><br>But that's not the point. The important part is that I wanted to develop a very short indie game (it took me 6 weeks) where the most important aspect was to have fun. That's how &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; was born\u2014a rhythm indie game designed to relax and enjoy. It's a small rhythmic challenge where you have a limited time to clean the house to the beat of the music.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rhythm-Based Gameplay: Clean the house by performing tasks to the beat of catchy music. Each step at the team of beat.<br></li><li>Time Challenge: You have a limited amount of time to complete your chores. (Of course, you can always lay dowm on the coach and do nothing)<br></li><li>Various Cleaning Tasks: Engage in different tasks like &quot;Simon says&quot; while recycling, dusting, and organizing, each requiring rhythmic precision.<br></li><li>Multiple Levels: Rigth now there is only one level developed, but in the future I would like to add multiple levels, each one with a new musical track and a unique set of chores to complete.<br></li><li>Casual and Relaxing: Designed to be a fun, stress-free experience that you can pick up and play anytime.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developer's Note:</h2>I developed &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; as a personal project with no greater ambition than to have a good time. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it. Thank you for playing and for your support!<br>If the game is well-received, I plan to continue developing it! If not, it will remain a short and fun experience.<br>The important thing is to have a good time!
