{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Electioneering</h2>Have you ever thought that the voters in Democracy 3 seemed a little bit *too* rational? a little bit too analytical about how government policy affected them? Blind to the public image of the candidates, unconcerned with the sound-bites and slogans of a real-world political campaign? Ever thought that your role as president or prime minister was suspiciously isolated from the concerns of wealthy party donors and public perceptions (even wrong ones) of your governments motivations?

Speeches can fill the gaps where policy has failed, or was maybe never even attempted!. If speeches don't get the job done, the election is near and opinion polls are low, manifesto promises allow you to make a loud clear commitment to policy decisions for after the election. If you win...well you *should* stick to them, but maybe its worth just taking the hit and quietly forgetting all about them?<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/483450/extras/e2.png?t=1478025153\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Donors &amp; Perceptions</h2>If rational debate and oratory do not win over the electorate, a major campaign of adverts just might, but to make that work your party needs funds. If membership is low, you can make up the difference with wealthy party-donors, but beware, upset them and they will keep their money in their pockets. If fundraising isn't cutting it, you may find a healthy dose of media-spin will persuade the voters to support you. Shake hands with soldiers, help out at a food-bank, visit an orphanage...whatever it takes to make the electorate think you are a compassionate, trustworthy and strong leader.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/483450/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1478025153","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/483450/page.bg.jpg?t=1478025153","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/483450/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1478025153","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/483450/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1478025153","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Electioneering</h2>Have you ever thought that the voters in Democracy 3 seemed a little bit *too* rational? a little bit too analytical about how government policy affected them?
