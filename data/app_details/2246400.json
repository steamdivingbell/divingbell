Looking around your house, you begin to notice things are different than what you remember. You use a camera to take photos to reveal the truth, to remember what was there. Your memory is fading; the longer things remain different, the faster you succumb. Keys to find, mysteries to solve, a home to explore. You need to keep your memory intact to put together pieces of your life and remember who you are and what has happened.

Over time, things will change and it is up to you to correct what changes in order to keep your sanity in tact.
