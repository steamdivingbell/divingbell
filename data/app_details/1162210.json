In fact, there is no adult content at all.\r\nAccording to the laws, games containing scenes of smoking, drinking of alchoholic beverages, usage of mild drugs are prohibited for the children. Our heroes drink wine, smoke hookah (presumably with mild drugs :) ).\r\n\r\nAlso our game contains quite a bit of erotic scenes, scenes of violence and gambling.\r\nWe were arguing in our team about the content rating of the game and decided to set the maximum possible just to avoid possible problems.\r\n\r\nSo, please have in mind: this game is NOT about tits and asses (well, not only about it :) ). This is the game about adventures, with spirit of old movies and books about barbarians, which we love. We tried to create something similar and hopefully we did it :)"},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMPORTANT, READ CAREFULLY!</h2><br>This DLC adds full content of the following game on Steam:<br><br>to the Non-Linear Text Quests.<br><br>Differences between the game added with this DLC and the standalone version:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You won't get the corresponding trading cards for the game, to get it you should buy the standalone version instead of this DLC.<br></li><li> You won't get the corresponding achievements for the game, to get it you should buy the standalone version instead of this DLC.<br></li><li> The price of this DLC is less than the price of the standalone version.<br></li><li> The content of the game will be the same as the standalone version.</li></ul><br>So, if you want to just play the game but you are not interested in the trading cards and achievements, you can consider buying this DLC.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DESCRIPTION</h2>The Barbarian and the Subterranean Caves is an adventure visual novel about the heroic feats of the intrepid warrior Ragnar.<br><br>Now you can become the famed adventurer Ragnar and bravely seek out all-new original adventures in this exciting game.<br><br>Delve into the mysteries of the caves and discover what lies in waiting below.
