{"about_the_game":"In the future, a race of sentient spacefaring frogs keeps to themselves in the corner of the galaxy. Their greatest and only-est defense: a bloodline of princess-pilots trained from birth in the art of space combat.<br><br>You are one such princess. The Klurxons, a ruthless bug-like race, prepares to invade from deep space, and they've got your prince. It's up to you to rescue him and crush the massive invasion before it's too late. Just you, your fighter ship, a few inept SpaceFrog allies, and whatever poor Klurxon suckers are dumb enough to get in your way.<br><br>GAMEPLAY<br><br>In each of the game's levels, you progress through a stunning retro spacescape full of obstacles (think: Starfox in VR), including neon nebulae, space broccoli farms, crystal moons, construction sites, and more. Dodge the obstalces by moving around the capture zone while destroying as many Klurxons as possible (also, before they destroy you). Each level hosts a vast range of Klurxon aliens intent on your destruction. To attack, move your controller along a punching motion, which fires a rocket from the end of your controller (aka, punch to fire rockets!). <br><br>FEATURES:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>More than 2 dozen unique enemies</strong> in the story mode campaign... including some bosses who really, really don't like you.
