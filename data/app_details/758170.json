While the mission of Santa Claus was to reward the good-hearted children of the world with gifts, Krampus on the other hand was to do the dirty deed of punishing the wicked children. The world was in balance.<br>But one day, Santa in all of his saintly wisdom had an idea, a change of heart. He no longer wished for the wicked children to be punished, but rather have all children be rewarded equally. Krampus, for the first time in millennia, spoke up with his disagreement.
