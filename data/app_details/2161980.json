{"about_the_game":"Survive<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will take care of a community of survivors, as you gather resources and explore the ruins of the world. Every time you die during a match, you will have two options: abandon the mission and lose your loot, or respawn and recover your loot at the price of losing one survivor from your community. The survival of your community depends on you, but you won\u2019t survive without them. If they don\u2019t survive, you will lose your main character for good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Weather<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe weather will affect you and your enemies. A cloudy sky will reduce the firing capacity of your weapons, but rain will naturally slow down your enemies. Fog will reduce your ability to detect the enemies around you, but a clear sky will make you more powerful than them. Plan your strategy and survive the weather.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe enemies<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe strange radioactive organisms that have infested the world are naturally invisible. Your technology forces them to become visible when they are inside an electric field that surrounds you. They also are highly radioactive, so eliminate them before they get too close to you. Some of them have the capacity to increase your levels of fear. Maintain low levels of fear, because it will affect your shooting skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour Weapons<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour weapons are capable of using two types of ammunition. Solar Ammunition and Oxygen Ammunition. The first one requires you to be directly under the sunlight to use its full power, while the second one will reduce your evasive abilities as it uses the same oxygen you need to survive.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2161980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1686365703","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2161980/page.bg.jpg?t=1686365703","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2161980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1686365703","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2161980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1686365703","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Use of weapons"},"detailed_description":"Survive<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will take care of a community of survivors, as you gather resources and explore the ruins of the world.
