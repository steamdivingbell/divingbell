{"about_the_game":"Cursor story is a cool and fun game where you play as a cursor (You don't control it with your cursor) in small Bullet-hell-ish levels about precision and timing. You explore all kinds of cool places (like the void and an island inhabited by dinosaurs) and meet cool, interesting, weird and funny characters (like a floating voice, three pirates and a frog (the frog isn't in the demo)). The cursor has lost it's memories so it teams up with the voice to get them back, and get the voice a new body. There's a lot of cool and unusual concepts that will for sure suprise you on your journey and there's about a 95% chance that you will have a good time. (Fun fact: The game was originally made in PowerPoint)","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2311010/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1675972269","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2311010/page.bg.jpg?t=1675972269","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2311010/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1675972269","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2311010/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1675972269","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Cursor story is a cool and fun game where you play as a cursor (You don't control it with your cursor) in small Bullet-hell-ish levels about precision and timing.
