Regardless of their fate, any item recovered by the hero can be transferred to another hero onto another machine or stored for later use. Remember, you haven\u2019t min-maxed unless you have min-maxed the min-maxing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thousands and thousands of items</h2><br>All of your auto-battling heroes will courageously always move to the right - as in all good retro games. However, this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re self-sufficient and it is in your interest to stack the odds in their favour. Stack them up with potions, items, and campaign gear.
