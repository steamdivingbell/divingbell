The elevator has cables and pulleys.  The pulleys control its speed and direction.  The elevator button suggests what the elevator should do next.  The elevator does what it wants next.  It is the elevator.  Take a meditative elevator journey as you travel between the floors.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Call To Action","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/c9910a6f2ba4a6ef3ca17ee4ad5e631da8144355.jpg"},{"name":"Traveling Without Moving","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/480c3085b0b9eb181376e8ea9a9a9a8d11c6b109.jpg"},{"name":"The Soundtrack of Our Lives @DickRambo","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/dee3be8776cf50ed0e409ab76adf0da6c2800f40.jpg"},{"name":"Meaning of Life","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/8ed72faeb7e72c88a7f6cb5e580f7cb7c6bb052c.jpg"},{"name":"Learned Helplessness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/bc11fc3caeb44a4cd22b880e6e65787b61bfe454.jpg"},{"name":"Sisyphus Challenge","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/4a503aa254a55eec633520d9c39ed8443920065e.jpg"},{"name":"Almost There","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/81c99d563da253b5203a5acd563a1208e33fdbf6.jpg"},{"name":"Journeyman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/d61446f508199e21763de17b1e3ea4cc0cb277f0.jpg"},{"name":"All Good Things","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/f8ba34b2274f6a99d5c78abb2da68fc0576032b3.jpg"},{"name":"Feeling Good","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/625180/6417a6db7fba2027b16336460c5561848ca1d5fd.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625180/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1590114739","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625180/page.bg.jpg?t=1590114739","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1590114739","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/625180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1590114739","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"You have boarded the elevator.
