{"about_the_game":"<strong>Holy Grain</strong> is the game your parents would not approve. It's a cult of absurdity and dark humor. It's an endless event explorer. A <strong>roguelike</strong> (or more like, roguelite) with a slightly different twist than the usual. It is a quirky blend that tastes like chocolate ice cream on a hot summer afternoon. In this game, you'll step into the shoes of an average kid whose life's sole purpose is to plant carrots and live a peaceful existence. The <strong>counselor</strong>, a senior with an anarchist mindset, will <i>guide</i> you toward a life of adventures and misfortunes. You'll swap carrots for soldiers and serene sunsets for bloody battles.

Each climate is a world unto itself, and every place you choose to visit will have its own challenges. The key is to plan your journey considering your army's resources and the dangers lurking around. You never know what awaits in that house on the horizon.<br></li><li> <strong>Events</strong>: Each time you progress within a region, you'll face a semi-randomly generated event. Many factors will decide its outcome, but it's your decisions that will determine whether you proceed wisely or not.<br></li><li> <strong>Combat</strong>: Eventually, you'll have to resort to force to emerge victorious from some events. After all, you have an army with you for a reason. In these fast-paced and frenetic battles, you'll need to make quick decisions and keep your combat skills sharp to avoid being executed by the enemy commander. Remember, if you die, it's game over.<br></li><li> <strong>Final Boss</strong>: This entire journey will lead you to the continent's supreme leader where you're located. Each continent has a specific structure, meaning some are more complicated than others. However, the ruling faction (and hence, the final boss you'll face) and the faction you lead also matter. What you need to know is that, to advance in the story and complete the last continent, you'll have to defeat each of the final bosses.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3424060/extras/Banner-factions-soldados-1.png?t=1736273384\" /><br><br><strong>With that being said, buckle up because the advisor is waiting for you.
