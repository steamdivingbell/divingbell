{"about_the_game":"<i>Cordial Greetings from Count Strahd Von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia</i><br><br>For many travellers, I have naught but contempt and slight regard, entering Barovia as they do in timid apprehension of her wonders. They are neither prepared for life high in the Balinoks, nor ready to accept its dangers. Here, the peaks of Baratak and Ghakis stand in cloaks of granite, their cowls of snow pulled securely about them as if they alone might endure the ancient night. <br><br>However, your party intrigues me. Perhaps the harsh cut of the wind or a storm in the forest does not alarm you. If that is so, I am certain our woods, streams and caverns will attract your interest, offering many a delightful diversion. Even the otherwise abysmal village of Barovia boasts a charming cemetery. You must visit it. Perhaps, if your party survives... that is, stays long enough in this harsh and unyielding home of mine, I may require its presence. I shall ask you to join me in Ravenloft, my castle upon the precipice overlooking Barovia. It is not an invitation to be refused. <br><br>I give my leave for your party to enjoy our misty, twilight dangers. Let you challenge your wits and fighting skills; may the perilous magics of my land enchant them. But heed this warning and do not play at cross-purposes with me. To stand against Strahd is to be at odds with life itself, for he who sends these greetings is the Lord and the Law of this brutal paradise. <br><br><i>With Gentle Regards, <br>Count Strahd Von Zarovich<br>Lord of Barovia</i>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904570/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648566583","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904570/page.bg.jpg?t=1648566583","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904570/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648566583","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1904570/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648566583","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Cordial Greetings from Count Strahd Von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia</i><br><br>For many travellers, I have naught but contempt and slight regard, entering Barovia as they do in timid apprehension of her wonders.
