{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developer's Note</h2><br>Hi, I'm Alex Schearer the founder of Spotted Zebra Software. I've been making games for a while, but always in two dimensions. I wanted to learn how to make 3D games and decided that making a game a week was a good, challenging way to do so. <br><br>Arrowpoint is my second week long game. You've got a bow, a horse, and a burning desire for glory. Luck would have it that there's a mysterious beast wandering the desert nearby, so what are you waiting for? Go forth and leave your mark on the world! Arrowpoint is a simple game about hitting a bunch of targets and waging battle with a huge beast. It's fun because firing arrows from horseback is fun and because waging war with giants is fun.<br><br>I'm releasing Arrowpoint for one dollar so people can join me in this crazy game-a-week adventure. If you'd like to share your thoughts, please leave a review or post to the Steam forums. If I get enough feedback I will improve the game based on what player's want.<br><br>Thanks for reading this; I really hope you enjoy the game!<br><i>Alex Schearer - Spotted Zebra Software</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Ride your horse and fire at increasingly more challenging targets.
