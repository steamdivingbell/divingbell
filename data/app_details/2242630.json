{"about_the_game":"The end of the world came and went. Now all that remains are heaps of corrupted flesh - the descendants of long ago animals and humans.  Most who exist in the world are too weak to change their own fate. Those who are strong have battled their way though the ranks and become self imposed bosses of tattered groups of minions. All are roaming through the desolation of Vicissity, some hoping to remain lost, others hoping to claim rulership over all that is left of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBattle increasingly challenging bosses<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuild your following<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClaim your reward of dominance from each foe you defeat<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDestroy all who stand against you and become the last ruler of Vicissity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast Ruler of Vicissity is a dark, single player deck building game. Start your campaign of domination with a small group of ten loyal followers. Build your wealth by gaining coin, jewels, and food. Learn the art of manipulating medicinal plants. Acquire weapons long forgotten across the devastated landscape. Use your assets to recruit more twisted souls who roam Vicissity. Sell off your valuables for wealth that persists between turns. Bribe enemy forces to join your team or murder them to remove them from your opponent's force for good. Send your army of dark followers to destroy your enemy. Drain your enemies health to 0 to conquer their dominion and claim it as your own.
