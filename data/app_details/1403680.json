{"about_the_game":"Bob Mazzolini Racing is a \u00bc mile drag racing game. If you like going fast and want to go faster, test and improve your reaction time while driving Bob Mazzolini mopar classics. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is as simple to play as holding the STAGE button until the light is green and releasing to go. You can then try to find the best shift points with a four speed transmission and try to improve your reaction time and try to break a record to get on the leader board. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGame is based on timing.  Better reaction time increases boost when you go. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny Mopar drag racing fan living in the West during 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s knows the name Bob Mazzolini. His name adorns the sides of some of the fastest and most successful Max Wedge &amp; Hemi powered Stock &amp; Super Stock cars of the era. - Scott Smith, Chrysler Power Magazine","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403680/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1600163395","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403680/page.bg.jpg?t=1600163395","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403680/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1600163395","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1403680/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1600163395","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Bob Mazzolini Racing is a \u00bc mile drag racing game.
