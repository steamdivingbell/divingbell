{"about_the_game":"<strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVE</h2></u></strong><br>Progress through the horrifying hospital, try not to fall prey for the monster who is somewhere in the darkness. Solve puzzles to get a step closer to the exit and making your way out of this nightmare. Your journey will only get more and more twisted, and troubled, as you move on.<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE MONSTER</h2></u></strong><br>The monster goes on a killing spree once it escapes its enclosure, and wreaks havoc, killing countless people. Escaping it is near impossible, due to it's stealth and quick movement. If you see him, RUN. The only option is to run for your dear life, before the monster reaches you and ends your life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</u></strong></h2>Demon Of The Dark is a 3D Exploration / Investigation indie horror project, made by a single-developer. The player, Ethan, investigates an abandoned medical research facility, to piece together the possible events that may have taken place. The player will face many obstacles, and will eventually face a mutated organism that kills anything it sees. As the player delves deeper and deeper into the facility, the more twisted it starts to become.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>STORY</u></strong></h2>You are Ethan Luke, a fairly new police investigator with a knack for solving mysterious cases. You find yourself standing outside an abandoned research facility late at night.<br><br>There have been numerous reports regarding the missing people lately. None of the people had any past criminal record or history. All investigations so far point out to this building that has been abandoned quite for some time. <br><br>As part of your job, you are directed to look into the whole area, as there has been a recent report of a fellow cop, Joseph William, a.k.a. Joey, being reported missing while investing the area. No words received from him after he went into this building. You are further advised to look for any clues, such as employee notes or any other hint around this facility to establish a better concept of the possible chain of events happened here.<br><br>These steps are not mandatory, but you need to check the whole hospital, until you are at the end. The SWAT team is being engaged and will be en route soon.<br><br>Good Luck.\u00a0You'll\u00a0need\u00a0it.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2582100/dd1c70aad3db98e20aee3ff61b9498250e8749d0.jpg"}],"total":1},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2582100?t=1722840322","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582100/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1722840322","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722840322","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2582100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722840322","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SURVIVE</h2></u></strong><br>Progress through the horrifying hospital, try not to fall prey for the monster who is somewhere in the darkness.
