{"about_the_game":"<strong>Shadow of The Forerunner</strong> is a card-based roguelike game with RPG elements set in a dark cyberpunk world. The game features a unique system of aspects and flaws, diverse equipment options, and prosthetics that influence the composition of your deck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">World</h2>Once, mystical power that entered through rifts from another dimension granted incredible strength to chosen individuals. However, everything changed when energy beings emerged from these rifts and began taking over the bodies of power users. The world plunged into chaos. Now, the remnants of humanity live in constant fear, and using this power always carries the risk of becoming a puppet of these sinister entities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">System of Aspects and Flaws</h2>Each new run will start with different aspects and flaws that balance each other. Aspects provide various positive bonuses and abilities, while flaws add negative modifiers to maintain balance. The stronger the aspects you receive, the more significant and unpleasant the flaw will be.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Equipment</h2>During your runs, you will find various equipment cards. Equipping these cards will add new cards to your deck and provide various bonuses. The equipment system allows for the creation of numerous deck combinations, and the right synergy with aspects can lead to spectacular results.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prosthetics</h2>Prosthetic cards provide various abilities in battles, but their use consumes both action points and limited energy points. Equipping prosthetics is only possible at certain locations, as is the restoration of energy needed for their use.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Power that Ruined the World</h2>The local &quot;magic&quot; available to your character grants mystical power in battles. This power allows you to perform actions that can drastically change the course of a fight. However, its use is limited by the number of magic points required, which are difficult to replenish.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3049160?t=1720540764","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3049160?t=1720540764","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3049160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1720540764","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3049160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1720540764","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Shadow of The Forerunner</strong> is a card-based roguelike game with RPG elements set in a dark cyberpunk world.
