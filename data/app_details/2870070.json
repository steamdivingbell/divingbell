{"about_the_game":"My Grandpa's Haunted House is a 2D top-down survival horror game based on the story of a girl named Emily who has returned to her grandpa's house from abroad only to find out that her grandpa passed away and his spirit got trapped in the house by a Demon.<br><br>During the early 1990s, Emily grew up living in her grandpa's house. She had a lot of fun memories with her grandpa in that house. During the early 2000s, she moved out of her grandpa's house and went to a foreign country in pursuit of better career opportunities. One day, she got a letter from her grandpa's address that stated his deteriorating health conditions, which compelled her to return to her country. But little did she know that her grandpa had already passed on 2 years ago and his house was full of the Evil spirits. The letter was delivered to her just to lure her back to her grandpa's house so that the spirits could take away her soul too.<br><br>After entering the building she called out to her grandpa but was met with silence. She realized that something was wrong and she started looking for him in the kitchen, dining and bed rooms. When she first came across her grandpa, she calmed down for a while thinking that he was okay. But when he got taken away by a Doppelganger right before her eyes she realized that it was her grandpa's spirit. The spirit taking him away looked exactly like her, with the same hair style which she used to wear when she was a child. This incident made her so angry that she wanted to fight back but it was a tall order for her without the expert's help. She took away her grandpa's belongings in a silver box in order to free her grandpa's spirit. Only if it were that simple. She decided to investigate the entire house in search of clues and to find out a way to free his spirit from the grasp of the demons residing in the house. <br><br>You play as Emily and will you able to find and free your grandpa's spirit from the grasp of the Demons? <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2870070/extras/mghh_gif_5.gif?t=1724989869\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore your grandpa's haunted house!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Collect items like silver box containing your grandpa's belongings, the ritual book etc.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Explore the scary basement, and spirit world.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Come face to face with Doppelganger, the dark entity and other spirits!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Avoid traps like spikes and more!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>About half an hour of paranormal investigation.</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2870070/extras/mghh_gif_3.gif?t=1724989869\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Warning:</h2><i>This game contains flashing lights which may not be suitable for people with epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions.
