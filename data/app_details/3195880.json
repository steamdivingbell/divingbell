{"about_the_game":"Send your heroes deep into bogs where solid ground meanders through noxious water and ancient castle walls collapse into nearby sludge with the Winlu Fantasy Tileset - Swamp pack! Winlu is back with another tileset for your MV/MZ games, this time filled with all the greens and browns your swampland and marshes could need. A1, A2, and A5 tiles along with 5 B sheets (4 for exteriors and 1 for interiors) are filled with creepy twisted trees and muddy autotiles to create semi-safe paths between pools of brown, blue, green, or purple water so you can show the area becoming more deadly as your heroes journey deeper into the swamp. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes 12 character sheets filled with decorations to help add even more life to your swamps! Have tattered and stained banners flutter in the breeze while lanterns hung from wooden posts offer an eerie green light to help your heroes stay on the path. Block off the witch\u2019s hut with a gate formed of magically grown branches that can only be opened by activating skulls with clattering jaws hidden around the swamp, and sink a wooden treasure chest into the murky waters while bubbles of unknown gasses rise from below and burst. Pick up the Winlu Fantasy Tileset - Swamp pack and send your heroes on a wild adventure to save a cursed princess or just add a new gorgeous area for your players to explore<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContents:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* 12 character sheets<br />\r\n* 8 tile sheets<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerms of Use:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack is for use in RPG Maker Series or the engine of your choice.<br />\r\nOK to be used in Commercial projects<br />\r\nContents can be edited<br />\r\nOK for use in games with gore<br />\r\nOK for use in adult-rated games","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726764928","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726764928","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195880/c080ff12aebc7815cc8cc4fc7f56fe097dbb8c86/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726764928","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3195880/c080ff12aebc7815cc8cc4fc7f56fe097dbb8c86/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726764928","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Send your heroes deep into bogs where solid ground meanders through noxious water and ancient castle walls collapse into nearby sludge with the Winlu Fantasy Tileset - Swamp pack!
