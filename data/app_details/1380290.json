{"about_the_game":"Make friends, cast spells, and uncover secrets in your magical small town! Will you preserve the forest or let the town grow?<br><br><i>New Witch in Town</i> is a 750,000-word interactive YA fantasy novel by Grace Card. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.<br><br>When you were a kid, you lived with your grandmother in the small town of Silvertree, on the edge of a magical forest. Grandma is a witch, and she taught you how to use your magic to affect the natural world, too. \u201cMagic is a part of you,\u201d she always told you. \u201cLearning how to use it means figuring out who you are.\u201d<br><br>Now you\u2019re 19 and on your own. After years of living in the forest while you perfected your witchcraft, you\u2019ve returned to take care of your grandmother\u2019s house and crow-familiar while she\u2019s gone. Figuring out who you are feels more important than ever - not to mention, figuring out what Silvertree is. A lot is just as you remembered: the friendly generous next-door neighbors with a kid just your age, the proud town council, the quaint little shops with quirky punny names, the gentle shadowy forest full of magic.<br><br>But now it feels run-down, with potholes in the streets and overgrown empty lots where stores used to be. A big real-estate developer promises to help the town by expanding into the forest. What\u2019s the best thing for the people of Silvertree and for the magical forest? What mysteries wait to be uncovered in the town archives? And more importantly, where did your grandmother go?
