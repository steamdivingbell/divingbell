The primary fold type is the standard fold, which folds through all layers of the paper in a straight line. Later in the game you gain access to a second type of fold known as the top layer fold - an advanced technique that can be used to selectively fold or unfold just the top layer of paper.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game's mechanics are simple enough that just about anyone can pick up and play... You don't need to be an origami guru to enjoy folding. However, that's not to say the game is without challenges - mastery of the mechanics and completion of the game will require copious amounts of spatial logic and outside-the-square thinking.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Level Groups and the Three Star System</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each level in the game is categorized in a level group - early on in the game (after the first two groups) you unlock the ability to freely jump between all the levels in a group at your own pace.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3250730/extras/Stars.png?t=1738701852\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For every level in the game, you can earn up to three stars depending on your closeness in matching the target figure. Stars are awarded at thresholds of 75%, 90%, and 100% accuracy.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Level groups are connected by objectives, such as earning a set number of stars in a previously unlocked level group. Completing objectives will unlock connected level groups giving you access to more figures to fold, as well as unlocking additional techniques to improve your folding aptitude.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Handy Techniques for Success</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are various additional features to assist you on your folding journey that become available to you as you unlock more stars. For example, you can unlock grid, angle, and edge snapping when folding to augment your accuracy... There is also an overlay you can toggle that lets you visualize precisely where your folded figure doesn't match the target.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Lovely Aesthetic</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Subtle details like the shading of the paper when you make a fold, a faint glowing aura around brightly colored paper, and the blurred shadows in the background come together to produce a polished experience. There's a lot of eye candy, but you can also disable or adjust certain effects if you want better performance or a different look and feel.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Beats to Fold to</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Paper 2 features a lo-fi style soundtrack with 7 distinct songs that all have multiple layers that fade in and out in response to gameplay events.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3250730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1738701852","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3250730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1738701852","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3250730/24efc642927c99764ed0f886697e994a66a54b61/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1738701852","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3250730/24efc642927c99764ed0f886697e994a66a54b61/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1738701852","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":3293090,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3250730/extras/Fold_Flourish_With_Alpha_half.png?t=1738701852\" /></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>An Elegant Origami Puzzle for Everyone</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Paper 2 - Origami Refolded brings the art of paper folding to your PC with a stylish aesthetic and over 100 perplexing puzzles.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Satisfying Paper Folding Mechanics</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">With a smooth and responsive feel, folding in Paper 2 is a delight.
