To do this, you\u2019ll need to explore a huge abandoned children's camp, look for clues to identify the monster inside Sparky, and properly configure the protective terminal to deactivate it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Social deduction</h2>When you start hunting Sparky, the team doesn't know which of the players is marked. Determine whether you are marked and choose whether to reveal your status or keep it secret from the other players. Sometimes the help of other players is necessary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Increasing difficulty</h2>You don't have much time to admire the beauties of Amber's Park. Sparky's speed increases every second and there will inevitably come a moment when you can't escape from him. Use any opportunity to slow Sparky down to prolong yours or another player's life. If  one of your group dies, the team will be outnumbered, which makes surviving Sparky and looking for clues even more deadly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Spectator mode</h2>After your death, the game doesn't end. You still can watch the game via the camp\u2019s security cameras, and even help other players or hinder their attempts to catch Sparky.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Otter Creak Story</h2>Sparky Marky Online is a part of one big mysterious universe set around the small town of Otter Creek, with its own memorable characters and monsters.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2248290/extras/solve_puzzles2.gif?t=1707907923\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The multifaceted and rich world of Amber's Park is transformed with semi-randomization.
