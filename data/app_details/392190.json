{"about_the_game":"#SelfieTennis is a sandbox game where you play tennis with yourself. When you hit the ball over the net, you teleport to the other side and hit it back to get points. But once you start spanking the wonky Ball People around the court, things start to get really weird! Push the Ball People over the edge of the court and go for their hearts and you will find a range of tools that you can scroll through and select on the controller!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#SelfieTennis is much more than a tennis game with a really nice physics simulation and great AI, accessible to players of ALL ages and with ZERO motion sickness. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou play against yourself on a tennis court in the clouds, with Ball People surrounding you and messing around together with you. Their AI can be described as highly sophisticated, funny, stupid, and other things. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor hardcore tennis fans, we made the best physics system that we could, and tennis pros have confirmed that it is indeed a pretty good simulation, but without all the hassles of real life, such as running after the balls or not shooting at other people. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor people who enjoy playing in their own rhythm and not following rules, the game has a perfect mix of funky sandboxy upgrades such as: #lightsaber, #violins, #selfies, #bow and #arrows for that #archery mood, #ponycorn to let you move around on horseback (stick), and #hearts to break (to get more upgrades). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also support the HTC Racket tracker peripheral! Start the game with it activated and you can play two-handed (or dual-wield rackets) for an intense workout - the Ball People will take care of your balls, you just have to spank them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstructions<br />\r\nYou use the triggers to spawn the ball(s) and racket. Double-click on racket trigger to lock it. You can change controller hands on the small button above the touchpad. Knock #BallPeople off the court and take their hearts to enter #HeartAttack mode (time-limited upgrades).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#SelfieStick is on ball controller's grips and you can record a GIF and tweet it out via the touchpad - log on to your Twitter profile via the computer screen when you start the game.
