{"about_the_game":"Buddi Bot is an advanced AI designed to use neural network technology to be able to complete household tasks. However, technology can be tricky and disaster strikes when your expectations and Buddi's don't exactly meet.

Not so much for Buddi. YOU understand that trash goes in the trashcan, but Buddi is going to have to learn.<br><br>Training Interface - Oh, no. Buddi burnt the food or put the hot sauce in the washing machines? No matter. Buddi comes with additional software with features to rewind, retrain, and command him with just a click of a button.<br><br>Point and Click - The whole game is played with just your mouse. Less energy spent on understanding controls means more energy can be spent on trying to get Buddi to finally wash the dishes.<br><br>Buddi Bot is a 3-D, isometric puzzle game by The University of Texas's SAGA Lab. This game was created with the intent of displaying the positive and negative effects that the advancement of AI will present to society.
