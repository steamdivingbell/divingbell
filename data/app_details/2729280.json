{"about_the_game":"The Filter Engines Bolt-on contains 6 extra filter engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBand Exclude Filter is a 12dB/oct band exclude filter. Also known as a notch filter, this filter will remove a specified range of frequencies and retain the rest. You can use it to remove some mid range frequencies from a track, or produce a distinctive hollow sounding effect on white noise or distorted sounds. Modulate the frequency to produce filter sweep effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBand Pass Filter is a 12dB/oct band pass filter. This filter will allow through a specified range of frequencies and remove the rest. It can be used for a wide variety of effects including turning a voice into a telephone voice, hiss or bass removal. Modulate the frequency to produce band pass filter sweep effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHigh Pass Filter is a 12dB/oct high pass filter effect. This effect will remove low bass frequencies and pass only high ones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHigh Shelf Filter is a 12dB/oct high shelf filter. A high shelf filter will increase (or decrease) high frequencies, rather like the treble control on an old fashioned hi-fi system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLow Shelf Filter is a 12dB/oct low shelf filter. A low shelf filter will increase (or decrease) low frequencies, rather like the bass control on a hi-fi system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeaking Filter is a peaking filter with variable bandwidth. A peaking filter will boost or cut a specific range of frequencies, like one band of a graphic equaliser.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2729280?t=1734436133","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729280/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1734436133","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729280/d2a0367aa2aa1840f32ec7d63323b6930c1eae98/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436133","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729280/d2a0367aa2aa1840f32ec7d63323b6930c1eae98/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436133","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Filter Engines Bolt-on contains 6 extra filter engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBand Exclude Filter is a 12dB/oct band exclude filter.
