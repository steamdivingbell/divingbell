{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">STORY:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The year is 20XX, and the earth is peaceful. Until one day, a giant meteor hit the planet, killing off most of the population. The lucky ones were the ones who died. Right after the meteor hit, people started to shift into unthinkable creatures. You, alone, genetic researcher, have survived Slimeageddon in your underground bunker. You quickly learned how to gain control of the slimes and use their malleable DNA to fight back against the fowl creatures.

In the game, you play as a slime with low stats, and you roam the wild and collect DNA. DNA is used to unlock skills on the skill tree. There are over 1,000 skills to choose from, some with unique abilities and synergies. After each run your skills reset and you can start fresh on a new build with all the DNA you've gathered. So there's all kinds of mixing and matching possibilities.</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3423500/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737548250","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3423500/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737548250","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3423500/9cb5c59569369b89410f3dd2db7a6d6d82982a05/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737548250","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3423500/9cb5c59569369b89410f3dd2db7a6d6d82982a05/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737548250","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"It's mostly cartoony gore and inappropriate jokes."},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">STORY:</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The year is 20XX, and the earth is peaceful.
