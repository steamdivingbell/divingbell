{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the eerie, twisting paths of The Corn Maze, a simple yet atmospheric adventure where finding your way out is only part of the challenge. Armed with a flickering flashlight and your wits, navigate the maze, manage your flashlight\u2019s battery, and hunt for compasses to guide your way. But beware\u2014something might be lurking in the shadows. Can you make it through the maze unscathed?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Key Features</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Immersive Maze Exploration: Wander through a haunting corn maze with atmospheric sound and visuals. The maze's winding paths are designed to keep you on edge, while the eerie ambiance creates a tense, immersive experience. As you move deeper, the maze's environment reacts to your actions, adding a layer of unpredictability and mystery to each playthrough.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Resource Management: Your flashlight is your most important tool, but it has limited battery life. Players must search the maze for scattered batteries to keep the light shining. The decision to conserve your battery or use it strategically adds tension, as the darkness grows more dangerous without light. Manage your resources wisely, or risk losing your way in the dark.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Compass System: Hidden compasses scattered throughout the maze offer directional hints. They won\u2019t give away your exact location but will guide you to key areas, helping you make your way toward the exit. Additionally, wooden stakes with numbers are placed throughout the maze, allowing you to track your progress and orient yourself, adding a subtle layer of navigation to the gameplay.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Dynamic Exploration and Hazardous Environment: The maze is alive with danger. The deeper you venture, the more unpredictable the maze becomes. Unsettling sounds or visual cues will heighten the tension. The maze responds to your actions, making each decision\u2014whether to take a different path, conserve battery power, or trust the compasses\u2014crucial to your survival.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Jumpscares and the Alien Threat: As you explore, expect unexpected jumpscares designed to keep you on the edge of your seat. The real threat, however, is a mysterious alien lurking within the maze. It watches your every move, and its presence is felt through eerie sounds and strange visuals that increase the further you go. At any moment, the alien could strike, making every corner of the maze a place of danger.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Simple, Accessible Gameplay: The game is designed to be intuitive and easy to pick up, with no complicated tutorials required. The controls are straightforward, making it perfect for short, tense sessions. The gameplay focuses on exploration, resource management, and the thrill of the unknown, creating an accessible yet engaging experience for all players.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Tension and Mystery: The maze isn\u2019t just a puzzle\u2014it\u2019s a survival challenge. You\u2019ll need to stay alert as you traverse its paths, with each turn potentially hiding something sinister. The sense of danger and mystery builds as you progress, with atmospheric changes and unpredictable events creating a sense of urgency and fear. Trust your instincts, be cautious, and keep your wits about you as you explore the maze.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">About the Developer</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">At just 16 years old, I'm proud to introduce The Corn Maze as my first-ever game! The core gameplay came together in just one week, with another few weeks spent polishing, debugging, and fine-tuning the experience. This project was not only a fun creative challenge but also a chance to learn and grow as a developer.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I want to be transparent about the tools I used: while I relied on a bit of AI assistance to help speed up some aspects of development (like generating sounds or refining assets), the entire game was built and designed by me. Every detail, mechanic, and spooky corner of the maze was crafted with care and passion.</p>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"You Win!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3381880/37b4cbff11e43539c71bd6bbb849faffefacf2dd.jpg"},{"name":"What the heck is that?!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3381880/9f123aae941a326a41db1359fe8e0e0e184e8dfd.jpg"},{"name":"You're supposed to run...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3381880/59f9ec5a1ae925c23af53634dc016cc87e0e545a.jpg"},{"name":"Speed Runner!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3381880/5a96d4407f2f76bfb11288155ff0c1254e9ea3f8.jpg"},{"name":"Lost and Found","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/3381880/a65ba251dec4fcb0450255dcdc7941cf73a7d0ad.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3381880/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735156820","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3381880/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735156820","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3381880/00181ad9bbc48772dc45c427be5a0bcf7bdf326c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735156820","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3381880/00181ad9bbc48772dc45c427be5a0bcf7bdf326c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735156820","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Step into the eerie, twisting paths of The Corn Maze, a simple yet atmospheric adventure where finding your way out is only part of the challenge.
