{"about_the_game":"Evolution sims.<br>Seldom representing the concept of &quot;adaptation&quot; all too well, and often not particularly fun in the first place, games like Evo and Spore have always been the epitome of &quot;mixed bag, missed potential.&quot; But what if we took a different approach? Instead of attempting to adapt Darwin and Gregor Mendel's notebooks into a multi-genre anthology game about evolving from slime mold to a race of gods, <i>ErMa (Early Mammal)</i> focuses on being a heck of a fun topdown action game powered by triple-distilled character customization.<br><br><br>What makes Erma different?<br><br>- A highly developed movement and procedural animation system. Much work has gone into balancing ease of control with making it fun and challenging to chase down prey and flee from predators.<br><br>- Over 100 interchangeable body parts, organs, and elemental gland weapons let you turn Erma into anything you see fit. Want to play a fire-breathing dragon that flies over the land and snatches up prey with its pincer tail? A giant sea monster that picks off foes from the river with its elongated neck and tongue? A tiny rodent that avoids predators while scooping up small lizards with its vacuum mouth? A menacing mole that ambushes from the walls, swallows enemies its own size whole, and covers its retreat with a cloud of paralyzing electric vapor? The possibilities are as impactful as they are numerous!<br><br>- An arcady gameplay loop keeps the action and adaptation going nonstop. Spawn into large, procedural maps, complete various objectives while staving off starvation, and move onto the next challenge!<br><br>- Bosses; like, some PROPER, multi-phase action game battles with unique gimmicks and movesets, not just a handful of bigger enemies.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2963100/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1715380714","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2963100/page.bg.jpg?t=1715380714","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2963100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1715380714","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2963100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1715380714","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Evolution sims.<br>Seldom representing the concept of &quot;adaptation&quot; all too well, and often not particularly fun in the first place, games like Evo and Spore have always been the epitome of &quot;mixed bag, missed potential.&quot; But what if we took a different approach?
