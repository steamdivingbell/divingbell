{"about_the_game":"A third-person shooter set in an alternate universe in a fantasy setting.<br />\r\n    The main character falls into a time loop on the planet Nibiru. Your task is to break the time loop by solving the mystery of the conspiracy, going through all possible endings. <br />\r\n    The plot of the game takes place in an alternate universe. Humanity has gone far in development and is capable of interstellar travel and has thus colonized many planets in the galaxy. There are three main factions in the galaxy.<br />\r\n    The empire is very religious, archaic, has a strict hierarchy, aggressive, the goal is the revival of its former power and religious influence, which previously united all human planets, but later lost its former power, losing 80% of its influence in the galaxy.<br />\r\n    Federation - that arose within the empire in opposition to the old structure of the state, along the path of freedom of the economic, technological, social structure of life. Having won the civil war, it became a separate state with a little more power than the new Empire.<br />\r\n    The third faction is remote planets and sectors, or associations that have taken neutrality during the revolution and civil war. He called himself the Confederation of Free Colonies, whose goal was to uphold the colonies on their own definition of the structure of life, regardless of the Empire, the Federation and also from themselves. Each colony defines its own laws, beliefs and way of life. And the entire military and economic potential is aimed at preserving this.<br />\r\n  The plot of the game begins with the fact that you, as part of the Federation expedition, go to the disputed planet Nibiru to the Federation laboratory, but the planet\u2019s spaceship crashes and you are still captured in a time loop, where every certain time there is an explosion in the laboratory that kills everything around, while the laboratory is under siege by local colonial forces and an imperial cruiser has also been spotted in orbit.<br />\r\n    The game is created by one person and published in-house.
