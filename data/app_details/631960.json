If the rival has a ship on these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or part of it is considered to be destroyed, and the striker gets the right to make one more turn. The player's goal is to first hit all enemy ships.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/631960/extras/classic_game.png?t=1706518386\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/631960/extras/classic_game2.png?t=1706518386\" /><br>This project is the first public released on Steam for us.
