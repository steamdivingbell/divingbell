{"about_the_game":"Welcome to your first day on the job! Before any major crash tests can take place today, the test facility must be calibrated. Your directive is to fire up the facility by running a simple but crucial test using one of the crash test carts and the portable crash test barrier. Make sure the data recorders, measurement arm, and tunnel catapults are all operating on target. All future crashes initiated will depend on how well the system gets calibrated.
