{"about_the_game":"<strong>Early Access - Pre-Alpha open Playtest</strong><br><br>Welcome to The Otherwilde.<br><br>Enjoy a slow paced amble through a gorgeous world of photorealistic natural assets!<br><br>This is not a survival game, and there's no leveling, so you'll need to craft to make your way through the world. It's fairly chill, but bosses will be added later, and you do have to watch out for the wolves... and a few other things. <br><br>A robust crafting system is ready for you. You'll need to gather herbs to create potions, gather materials such as wood, stone, and iron, and build crafting stations. Not every tree is harvestable, not every rock is minable, and herbs are hard to find, so you'll have to learn where to find resources. You'll be able to build bases with incredible medieval assets (Wood for now, but we have plans! It's also clunky for the moment and very much in progress, but it will be amazing.). As you gather herbs and mushrooms, you may find seeds, ready for the complete and integrated farming system. <br><br>Interact with unexpected NPCs, and hunt wild animals for rare components. Sell your goods to a village trader, and buy unusual things. Find your way to the center of the maze to find treasure! Look for the hidden chests in the Alder Grove, and make your way through the Fen to find the Witches.<br><br>Whether you prefer cute villages, spooky swamps, or brushy alder groves full of natural resources, you'll find something to your taste.  As you explore, you'll find that most of the world is covered in grasslands or fantastic pine forests, but several areas have been finished with hand placed assets and detailed resources.<br><br>There is a complete TUTORIAL level available from the main menu that shows every asset and harvestable item in the game. <br><br>Please note that this game is in the EARLY ALPHA stage of development. It is completely playable, but only three sections have been completely added to the main map. There's plenty of stuff in the works, stay tuned for all the exciting updates!<br><br>Explore! Build! Farm! Conquer!<br><br>Looking forward to your feedback and enjoyment of The Otherwilde.<br><br>NOTE: Prices will increase with each significant update/upgrade to game content.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1989130/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1655926057","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1989130/page.bg.jpg?t=1655926057","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1989130/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1655926057","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1989130/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1655926057","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Early Access - Pre-Alpha open Playtest</strong><br><br>Welcome to The Otherwilde.<br><br>Enjoy a slow paced amble through a gorgeous world of photorealistic natural assets!<br><br>This is not a survival game, and there's no leveling, so you'll need to craft to make your way through the world.
