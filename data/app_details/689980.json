The easy and medium ones are the best choice for people starting their adventure with games of this type and preferring a peaceful gameplay while enjoying the plot and campaign, and the highest level has been designed for economic simulators veterans meaning that even a simple mission during the adventure might turn out to be quite demanding.

You can be a law-abiding and responsible dealer who, using the experience gained while working with his uncle in his youth, will dynamically expand the business and ensure the satisfaction of his customers. The opposite choice will allow you to take a &quot;mafia&quot; route where you will use the cheapest solutions when repairing and selling cars to deceive your customers and earn large amounts of cash as soon as possible. There will also be the possibility of stealing a vehicle at the request of shady customers.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/story_3.gif?t=1709548064\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game economy - is it better to invest in advertisement or repairs? </h2>There are many economic choices ahead of you. Invest in new employees, repair some cars for additional profit or maybe advertise? This system will allow you to feel like a real business owner, one that in many situations has difficult choices to make on how to invest his earned fortune to double it in the future. A random event system has been implemented in the game that will from time to time impact your business - positively or negatively - and you will be able to experience it during the campaign.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/gif_ads_3.gif?t=1709548064\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Map handling system and personnel management.</h2>Car Trader Simulator has a map management and employee management systems. You can specify exactly which streets can be traveled by our employees who will transport and repair purchased (or stolen) cars. In addition, the events system will allow you to diversify the game with unexpected events or activities taking place in the city. To make it easier to navigate the map, it has been divided into mechanically distinctive sections (and that refer to the names of widely known districts of the USA).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real cars</h2>The game has a gigantic (purchased) library of real car photos (over 1000 cars in many different variants). Each set of photos is a complete set with vintages and models of a given car, additionally available in any color combination. By playing through the main campaign plotline we will also be able to spot some of the very unique model of cars. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/browsers3.gif?t=1709548064\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Auctions - key to success when developing a business</h2>There are many cars available in the game that you will be able to negotiate for or buy directly on the internet auctions. Every few minutes new cars will appear on auction alongside a group of people willing to pay for the best models. Not only will you need to have cash, but you will also have to bid wisely to get the most from the auctioned vehicle.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/sell.gif?t=1709548064\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Direct sales - contacting the customer</h2>Having a good car for sale is only half the battle, the other half is dealing with the customer and meeting his expectations. With each conversation, you will get guidelines on what the customer expects from you and your task is not only to sell the car but also to make the buyer happy and ensure our reputation to not fall. Coupled with our progress in the campaign customers will appear more often at our doors and our decisions regarding the appropriate car selection will have to become more accurate. <br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/Follow.gif?t=1709548064\" />","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Welcome to the business kiddo!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/b591beea747a21e011cf82f6ed2a3872ad32b0a6.jpg"},{"name":"It\u2019s getting better and better!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/06c693538011d4bddf0ebc08571c799433041b2d.jpg"},{"name":"Officially a Car Trader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/20e03c0ada73153c62cf7593088e8f7f95efa125.jpg"},{"name":"Mr/Mrs Car Trader","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/52ef097ba40f707683d9cc7d8b8f19418834c000.jpg"},{"name":"Am I playing too much?","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/016b5f50703cab750dc9247752e9bf9a31649cbe.jpg"},{"name":"Sleep is a weakness","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/cd383665ef096a275032262b7bcdf40390026048.jpg"},{"name":"First step","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/ea2c59d57311e9ccc00e5cdbae454afda1c73a7c.jpg"},{"name":"Getting experience","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/ab7c02fa24620dca037447b9979aeb16ef70b765.jpg"},{"name":"It doesn\u2019t look good when it\u2019s broken!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/0c74001ebf7a42d01e105ead203376aeff0e0912.jpg"},{"name":"I\u2019m a famous painter!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/689980/b0be96f4cd42640cc5b160c94b87a20222ce3f85.jpg"}],"total":69},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1709548064","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/page.bg.jpg?t=1709548064","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1709548064","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1709548064","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":1295780,"description":"Play Now!"}],"detailed_description":"<h1>MORE GAMES</h1><p><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/Follow.gif?t=1709548064\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/689980/extras/Przechwytywanie.png?t=1709548064\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THIS GAME</h2><strong><i>Welcome to the Car Trader Simulator!
