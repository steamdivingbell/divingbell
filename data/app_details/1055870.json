Around the walls of the carriage were people in worn clothes. Through the half-open door, a blizzard raged outside. An inner voice spoke: \u201cMaybe if the train slowed down, I would be able to escape.\u201d I jumped out, landed in a snowdrift, and suddenly I was again in Jozwiak-Rodan\u2019s cozy apartment. \u201cI think history should be told in a way that young people can understand it,\u201d he said as I put the virtual reality goggles and controllers on the desk. And so, he and his programmer friend Jacek Ross started developing the VR game Siberian Run in 2018. Immersed in a virtual Siberia, players take on the role of a fugitive trying to avoid capture. They can collect different objects that help on the quest and interact with the world around them. The shouts of guards calling out from somewhere in the snowstorm reminds players that time is running out\u2014and that each mistake can cost you your life.
