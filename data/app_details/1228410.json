{"about_the_game":"<strong>This is a platform puzzle game related to our &quot;Perspective&quot; vision.</strong><br><br>There are a lot of games about<strong> &quot;Vision&quot;</strong>, such as &quot;Monument Valley&quot;, &quot;Fez&quot;, or &quot;Superliminal&quot;.

Yes, &quot;Fez&quot; is an important source of inspiration for this game, which uses the same &quot;camera rotation mechanism&quot;.<br><br>But what's significantly different from &quot;Fez&quot; is that it adds <strong>&quot;Perspective&quot;</strong>.<br><br>&quot;Perspective&quot; is the soul of this game, and it is also the soul of our eyes. With it, our eyes have the feeling of <strong>&quot;Depth&quot;</strong>. For example, the building in the distance is as high as the tea cup nearby, one hand nearby looks large enough to hold a Boeing 747, and with one jump, we can cross the mountain top in the distance, and so on.<br><br><strong>&quot;Perspective&quot;</strong> is usual but magical. It makes our life more colorful.<br><br>In this game, you will use &quot;Perspective&quot; to overcome various difficulties, such as, jump over a huge pit, or jump up to the top of a building.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u8d8a\u8fc7\u770b\u4f3c\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6df1\u5751.gif?t=1709135306\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u8df3\u4e0a\u770b\u4f3c\u9ad8\u4e0d\u53ef\u6500\u7684\u697c\u623f.gif?t=1709135306\" /><br><br>You also need to avoid seemingly inescapable obstacles, or avoid lasers that can really kill you at the touch, or step on massive and dangerous robots, and let light travel from here to there ( sometimes you are the light yourself ).<br><br>In this game, you will use various tools, which can better assist you to use the<strong> &quot; Perspective&quot;</strong> to overcome difficulties, such as,<strong> &quot;X&quot;</strong> that can move the camera horizontally.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u8ba9\u955c\u5934\u6c34\u5e73\u79fb\u52a8\u7684X.gif?t=1709135306\" /><br><br>There are two other tools I didn't say, and how to use them depends on your intelligence.<br><br>In addition to the these tools, you will also need to use some props, such as a wooden box or something like it, you have to push them or take them to the right place.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1228410/extras/\u5f88\u666e\u901a\u7684\u6728\u7bb1\u5b50.gif?t=1709135306\" /><br><br>You will encounter more strange boxes, green buckets that can be picked up and hold water, and fans that can let you fly into the sky.
