{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Reborn merges elements from three  genres: Idle, Roguelike, and RPG, but is not fully defined by any one of them. The game mostly plays in the background, encouraging you to check in periodically to level up stats, manage inventory, take on quests, craft gear and potions, or simply get to know the villagers. Designed to be enjoyed over several months, Reborn lets you witness your character's growth as time passes.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">To be clear, Reborn isn\u2019t for everyone. If you're after an action-packed, hands-on experience, this may not be your ideal game. Though there are plenty of tasks and challenges, much of the game is spent passively as your character auto-battles through endless waves of creatures. The core challenge lies in planning and customizing your character\u2019s build, gathering resources and experience, and completing tasks around the village.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Idle Gameplay:</strong> Let the game run while you focus on key moments of decision.
