{"about_the_game":"This adventure game uses lore and concepts of my tabletop RPG system, Watchers of the Universe. The whole story revolves around the exciting theory, based on the work of Zecharia Sitchin, that the Earth was colonized by an extraterrestrial contingent 450,000 years ago. The narrative is provided by clay tablets found in the library of Ashurbanipal around 1852, first translated by Sitchin but never acknowledged by mainstream science.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe astonishing information is that these alien humanoids are to thank for all the major foundations of our civilization, but also for the socially negative things (kingship, oppression, slavery, speculative monetary system, banking, warfare, feuding and the like).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur Watchers have existed since Nibiru was ruled by self-proclaimed, power-obsessed interest groups, that is, since ancient times. The tradition has been inherited from what they call The Prior Times, as there has always been a need for a loyal, well-trained team that can be deployed anywhere, with members able to serve the ruler in all possible circumstances without unnecessary questions. For a very long time, the Watchers were not immortal, only, like their masters, very long-lived. Immortality had to wait until technology made it possible.<br />\r\nThey appear in the Bible.<br />\r\nIf we want to characterize them briefly, we can say that these Watchers are galactic task executors. They rarely go their own ways, mostly following the instructions of their masters to the letter. Intolerant of contradiction, ruthlessly, insensitively. While performing their dangerous duties, of course, they are embroiled in adventures that are incomprehensible to the average person. In the course of their endless missions, they gradually lose their characteristic human qualities and become automatons.<br />\r\nWatchers cannot be automatically called evil, they simply lack the compassion, love, affection, and similar human qualities of the average person because of their extended, sometimes eternal, lives. They might have had something like this in them, but it has gradually worn out. And what are they good at anyway?<br />\r\nIn addition to fighting skills, for example, in bootlicking.<br />\r\nAs it soon turns out, this not-so-revered trait on Earth could elevate them to a position where they can no longer be compared to mortals, either physically or mentally. Here we would immediately point out that this has been observed for quite some time in history, but today we have reached a technological height where bootlicking can be taken to a new, paradigm shifting level, and this usually does not meet the criteria dictated by common sense or public interest.<br />\r\n&quot;I'm outta here&quot; is a short introduction of how a common Namlugallu (Nibiran person) MAY become a Watcher.
