{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2455200/extras/2023-05-27_075_2.png?t=1724746161\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complex &amp; Unique</h2>&quot;Galactic Defense: Automation&quot; is a game designed for players who enjoy complex gameplay. In this game, you take on the role of a commander on the galactic frontier defense line, under human rule. Your task is to command and organize the development and expansion of military and civilian activities. Meanwhile, the indigenous alien species in the universe, known as the &quot;Cleansers,&quot; stand in opposition to humanity. For them, human expansion is a threat to the universe, a pollution of the cosmos. Therefore, they have decided to eliminate humanity and protect the universe.<br><br>Players primarily strengthen themselves by collecting resources, planning construction, building and producing, and recycling resources. The &quot;Cleansers,&quot; on the other hand, follow a completely different logic. They are wary of humans but gradually test and slowly harass them until they are provoked!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simulation - Life Cycle</h2>This is a unique simulation game. It simulates real-time strategy games, but everything is automated! All units in the game have their own production, development, death, and recycling cycles, which happen automatically without player intervention. The player's task is to strategically place construction plans and design optimal defense and production layouts to counter enemy attacks and ultimately eradicate the enemy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Massive Battles with Minimal Controls</h2>The game features an astonishing number of units on the screen, with nearly 100 units initially and up to 500 units in the later stages. Players only need to make a few clicks. They simply need to place construction plans, and the game's AI takes care of the rest. The game also offers a pause and resume function, allowing players to give orders to units while paused.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2455200/extras/2023-05-27_079_2.png?t=1724746161\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Respects Players' Time</h2>Each game session lasts approximately 30 minutes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ecological Cycle</h2>All units in the game have their own production, development, death, and recycling cycles, which occur automatically without player intervention.
