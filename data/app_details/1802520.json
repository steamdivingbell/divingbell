{"about_the_game":"&quot;A snowy VR counterpart to Firewatch&quot; - 4players.de <br><br>In this exploration adventure on skis you take a well-deserved time out. After everything that happened recently, you figure you really need to take a break and get away from it all. You sign up for a volunteer job with the Snow Scouts, a non-profit organisation that runs some ski resorts high in the mountains. You will be responsible for fixing up an entire valley all by yourself, only being guided by your supervisor via radio. You'll try out and open all the different ski slopes, test the snow cover for any avalanche risk, and if need be, set off a calculated avalanche to ensure safety for others. You'll even come across some rare alpine birds, get a chance to open new paths and get to know your supervisor - and maybe even yourself - a little better through radio conversations. Up here in this pristine mountain environment, with you all alone in nature, nothing can go wrong.
