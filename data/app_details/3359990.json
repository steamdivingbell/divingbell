{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Skullhunter is about a skeleton\u2019s journey to retrieve his skull, and help Wally the Worm get his family back, who was living in his skull until they were kidnapped.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/extras/Intro.png?t=1737855397\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You control the skeleton as he rebuilds his body with weaponized limbs and powerful skulls. More powerful weaponry often requires the completion of side quests, from a multitude of NPCs, to acquire items. Skulls are gotten by hunting the very powerful bosses, and after defeating them, you can wear their heads as your own! These give you a multitude of unique powers, changing your playstyle and helping you beat the 13 unique bosses (including 4 mini-bosses), each with their own unique theme song!<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/extras/Inventory.png?t=1737855397\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Keyboard controls: wasd/arrow keys to move, e to access equipment, left mouse button to select and attack, and b to advance text.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">X box controls: left stick to move, right stick to aim and move selection, rb to select and attack, b to advance text, and start to access equipment.\u00a0</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game includes a strategic feature of tombstones, which manipulate combat, and also hold any skulls you may have lost on your journey.

The recommended mode for a first time player with lower top down adventure fighting experience is fontanelle, where you can get hit one extra time. For experienced players, normal mode is a good introduction into the merciless game. Radiation + mode gives certain creatures improved attacks, leading to more intense situations, and Zero Cell mode destroys some of the Cell Towers, areas that Wally can bring you back to respawn. These two modes are good for a second run through the game if you are looking for a challenge (but if you can handle them, all modes are unlocked to begin the game). Super Baby Playtime mode is good for\u2026 well, babies of course! (or people who have never played a fast-paced video game before.) You can always change the mode when continuing after closing the game, so don\u2019t feel stuck to one mode!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">(Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\\/</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/extras/goodluck.png?t=1737855397\" /></p>","achievements":{"total":0},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737855397","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/page.bg.jpg?t=1737855397","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/408c26e4eace212f266fc9963e3ccf327109438e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737855397","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/408c26e4eace212f266fc9963e3ccf327109438e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737855397","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Skullhunter is about a skeleton\u2019s journey to retrieve his skull, and help Wally the Worm get his family back, who was living in his skull until they were kidnapped.<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3359990/extras/Intro.png?t=1737855397\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You control the skeleton as he rebuilds his body with weaponized limbs and powerful skulls.
