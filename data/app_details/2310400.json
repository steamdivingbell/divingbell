{"about_the_game":"A short 20 minute non-linear narrative game about negative experiences after coming out as transgender.<br><br><strong>Developer's Note:</strong> This is a rather indulgent and unforgiving game, at least for me, as it only contains negative experiences. I recommend you only consider playing this game if you have the emotional capacity for it. I hope that it can give cisgender people an idea of what being transgender is like and for those who are transgender themselves that they are not alone in their experiences and that there's someone else who has felt the pain too. But, I also made this game for myself. I've made this game the same way you might write about the painful, dark memories you have in a journal to help process it and move on.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2310400/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1724989158","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2310400/page.bg.jpg?t=1724989158","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2310400/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724989158","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2310400/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724989158","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Contains transphobia, gender dysphoria, misgendering."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"A short 20 minute non-linear narrative game about negative experiences after coming out as transgender.<br><br><strong>Developer's Note:</strong> This is a rather indulgent and unforgiving game, at least for me, as it only contains negative experiences.
