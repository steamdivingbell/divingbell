{"about_the_game":"For Jacob Kirby, today is the day of the big con. He's got his outfit ready. He hasn't forgotten his badge.The only thing that can derail an entire weekend of panels, cosplay, and consumerism is the fact that an inter-dimensional war might break out on the con floor! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp Jacob make the right choices as he's forced into the position of diplomat between three out of this world super-beings ready to turn the convention floor into a pile of ash. An alien princess from beyond the stars. A master thief from another dimension. And the magical girl protector of earth. The other con-goers might mistake them for just girls in costumes, but all of their lives are at stake. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd this isn't the kind of diplomacy that happens over a table in the conference room. If Jacob wants to save the convention, perhaps the entire planet, he's going to have to romance these super-powered cuties! Enjoy the con, save the world, fall in love. All of that and more in Cosplay Convention Crisis!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/851620/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1573176959","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/851620/page.bg.jpg?t=1573176959","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/851620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1573176959","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/851620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1573176959","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"For Jacob Kirby, today is the day of the big con.
