In merely 10 years, the original Utpia deteriorated into the human zoo of hell that it is today. Unable to witness the unsightly state of corruption Utpia has descended into, the legislators signed into law a madman decision to authorize the killing of other individuals -- murder -- as a legal, legitimate act. The profession of murderers will not be interfered with by the government in any way, but only under the circumstance that no other citizen knows about it. If anyone is to find out about the murder and has sufficient evidence to incriminate and prove one guilty, the murderer will be convicted and executed.<br />\r\nIn the distant land of the 18th ward in Utpia, a young murderer named Pekah Aldrich just woke from his dark, somnolent dream, about to go into the finals weeks of his life-changing sophomore year of high school.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAuthor notes:<br />\r\nCurrently, only the demo is finished.
