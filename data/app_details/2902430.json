{"about_the_game":"<i>Design the perfect defence system for the city in this physics-based game. Stop the falling celestial objects with turrets, fire, lightning, portals and more! 60+ levels that will challenge your ingenuity and creativity.</i><br><br>Falling Stars is a building puzzle game where players design the defence system of a city to protect it from falling celestial objects. It's a mix between a tower defense and a puzzle game, with physics that resembles a pinball machine.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">+60 levels</h2>Each new level will bring new challenges and the designs to pass them will need to be more complex. Each new world will add a new object that you can build that will add a new mechanic and a new way of challenging you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Infinite solutions.</h2>Our puzzles can be solved in infinite ways and they encourage players creativity. Create an efficient and clean solution, or a messy and overengineer one. The sky is the limit!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Physics are fun!</h2>Sit back and watch the chaos produced by the objects falling, bouncing and exploding!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rethink and iterate.</h2>You can modify your buildings endlessly until reaching your perfect design. All levels will save your solution so you can always come back and tinker with them at any moment.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2902430?t=1734793653","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2902430?t=1734793653","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2902430/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734793653","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2902430/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734793653","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<i>Design the perfect defence system for the city in this physics-based game.
