There is no one else other than you to cope with all these. Your only weapon is your wit against this crooked world until you reach the point to hell with it. This won't just go forever like that. Your relationship with other worms will change as you progress.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">I once loved too</h2>Throughout the story, you will occasionally visit some memories or analogical mini levels with different gameplay than the main part of the game. These levels will unlock new abilities the worm can use. These abilities are not mere powers. They are part of the actual character progression itself and they will start to change the main gameplay and story.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1303620?t=1724411901","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1303620?t=1724411901","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1303620/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1724411901","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1303620/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1724411901","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":1316900,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Creep is a 2D platform game that takes place inside a struggled person's inner world represented as a worm world.
