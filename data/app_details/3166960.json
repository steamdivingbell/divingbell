{"about_the_game":"The world is dead, its corpse a feast for the Dire Gods\u2019 hunger. Exiled from heavens, they claimed their blood right to reign over the mortal plane. And the Divine dared not risk war for man\u2019s salvation. <br><br>The day the mortals died, their cries were met with silence. Their ash is now subject to Baal-Marduk.<br><br>In the Hallowed Halls, whispers of doom grow louder, proclaiming that it may already be too late. But war is coming. This time, the Forces of the Light must rise and take up arms \u2014 or perish.<br><br>As the Radiant Armada descends upon the mortal plane, you are chosen as one of their leaders. You will command this holy coalition to victory. You will wield its armies as a divine spear, aimed to pierce the dark heart of the World Eater..<br><br>What shall be your command?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ACTION RPG WHERE YOU COMMAND AN ARMY</h2><br>With Armageddonica, we want to fuse modern ARPG combat with the feel of the classic real-time strategies we grew up loving. Players take control of powerful hero characters called Champions \u2014 each with unique skills and abilities \u2014 while leading a divine army made up of dozens of distinctive units. You\u2019ll recruit or summon troops at will, upgrade both your heroes and your forces, and adapt your strategy on the fly \u2014 all in the epic battle to bring down the Dire Gods!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UNLEASH THE WRATH OF HEAVEN</h2><br>Each Armageddonica playthrough is a roguelike challenge, designed for intense, high-stakes skirmishes. Start by building your base, then explore the map to upgrade your hero, recruit new units, and prepare for the battle ahead, vanquishing the enemy in a decisive blow \u2014 all in a span of 10 to 30 minutes. Tailor your forces to suit your playstyle \u2014 whether you favor the precision of a surgical strike or the overwhelming momentum of brute force attacks. Mix, match, and master your army to crush the demonic legions that stand in your way!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ASSEMBLE A DIVINE ARMY</h2><br>The Radiant Armada is a coalition between many different factions. The high-tech Paragons and the biologically advanced Seraphs, who have set aside their mutual burning hatred. The heroes of the past bestowed with immortality, still blaming angels for the mortals\u2019 doom. The hordes of the undead conscripted from Hell and lured from Purgatory with promises of Heaven. Melee fighters, ranged sharpshooters, support troops \u2014 all ready to be spawned at your will. Gather an army worthy of the heavens!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADAPT TO THE ARMAGEDDON</h2><br>In your war against the Dire Gods, every battle demands a new approach. As you explore quests scattered across the map, you will unlock better gear and adapt your Champion to the challenge ahead of you. Each playthrough challenges you to adapt your skills and equipment on the fly, making every run a fresh test of your tactical thinking.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REBUILD THE KINGDOM OF LIGHT</h2><br>Between battles, take rest in the Bastion \u2014 your sanctuary and base of operations. As you upgrade the Bastion, you will unlock new tech, units, abilities and storylines. Construct buildings, evolve your forces, and revisit earlier battles for greater challenges and ever more glorious rewards. In your fight against Baal-Marduk, the Bastion will become a beacon of hope and celestial power. It is your duty to protect it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIVE INTO A STORY OF COSMIC PROPORTIONS</h2><br>Armageddonica is a story of the fight against Baal-Marduk, a Dire God bent on destroying every living thing in the universe. After ousting his sadistic uncle Enlil for conspiring with Angels, and murdering his cousin Ninurthar, Baal-Marduk\u2019s hunger knows no bounds. The Goddess Ishtar, meanwhile, has her own agenda, taking aim at the crown fallen from Enlil\u2019s head. Will you be able to stop them?","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166960/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737479148","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166960/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1737479148","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166960/06de4bc568326c7ce8b57f79e24f0bd1aedb3649/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737479148","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3166960/06de4bc568326c7ce8b57f79e24f0bd1aedb3649/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737479148","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The world is dead, its corpse a feast for the Dire Gods\u2019 hunger.
