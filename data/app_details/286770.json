The story itself is pretty much standard Hollywood fluff, so expect betrayals and some stiff banter in the cut-scenes. Shadow Ops makes use of standard first-person shooting techniques, but offers a very helpful lean function that actually is something other developers should rip off. Yes, lean has been used before, but it's very effective and even vital in ShOps.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 IGN<br><br>\u201cGeneral movement is easy enough, and thankfully the standard control layout you would expect in a first person shooter is here. The action is fast paced, and you will have to keep on your heels to succeed in completing the missions, so a simplified control scheme is a godsend.\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 GamesHell<br><br>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a decent shooter you\u2019ve come to the right place. All of the sounds are superb and the audio separation comes through very clearly. To complement the gunfire and chaos is a heart thumping soundtrack that helps convey the situation. It goes for a sort of middle eastern chant that was prevalent all throughout movies like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator and it works really well here.\u201d<br>6.4/10 \u2013 Gaming Nexus<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_4c494f97475e1ae40a48b9d810dc399533dc78ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_4c494f97475e1ae40a48b9d810dc399533dc78ff.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_db04f57b15f0124bf5c0651a04ce84e5152ece93.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_db04f57b15f0124bf5c0651a04ce84e5152ece93.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_180bab3d89e8178364eef8648b8fa71286147a45.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_180bab3d89e8178364eef8648b8fa71286147a45.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_8761d03bbe92bcfe0dbb857973dd9fc2d4008584.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_8761d03bbe92bcfe0dbb857973dd9fc2d4008584.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_01bfcca38d0c891ca0d03b19a55fe7ef78da0cc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_01bfcca38d0c891ca0d03b19a55fe7ef78da0cc9.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":5,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_c59892e08d5503a2aba48da511b530f7d2bbe62a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_c59892e08d5503a2aba48da511b530f7d2bbe62a.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":6,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_510e596872f5ae44ade314e668723def8c141f3a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_510e596872f5ae44ade314e668723def8c141f3a.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"},{"id":7,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_d1c482ff579756f8c03106723d5109242a21b078.1920x1080.jpg?t=1689356876","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/286770/ss_d1c482ff579756f8c03106723d5109242a21b078.600x338.jpg?t=1689356876"}],"short_description":"Race against time and terrorism as a member of the elite counter terrorist team in this all-out first person shooter.
