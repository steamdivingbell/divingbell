{"about_the_game":"<strong>Breed Packs</strong><br><br>Following in our series of New Breeds (which are now included in Creatures Docking Station), we released a series of uniquely themed Norn Packs which enhance Docking Station or Creatures 3 with four completely new breeds of Norn and loads of neat agents - everything from weird plants and cool toys to strange gadgets and even stranger bugs and critters.<br><br>Each of these Norn Packs contained one brand new Norn breed and three or more agents that were designed to match the general theme of the pack. For example, our Toxic Norn Pack comes along with a few toxic foods that are essential to keep the Toxic Norns alive.<br><br>For every Norn Pack there is a special online Care Guide which gives you a few hints and tips on how to care for these new Norns. The Care Guides briefly cover the most important things to keep in mind whilst caring for each of these additional Norn breeds.<br><br>Also included here are the Banshee Grendels. Quite unlike the relatively docile Grendels which come along with Creatures 3, these Grendels grow up to develop a serious dislike of their happy-go-lucky Norn cousins!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Contains the notorious Banshee Grendels and four new norn breeds - each with their own look, genetics, and several agents.<br></li><li><strong>Bondi Norns</strong><br>These iridescent blue beauties love nothing more than to spend all day playing around on beaches. They age slower (and live longer) than other breeds, but aren't immortal. They can also survive underwater a bit longer than other breeds, and won't feel homesick anywhere! <br>Their pack also comes with a beach ball, the didgeridoo and the Crobsters - edible (especially for Bondi) amphibious critters with a complete life-cycle!<br></li><li><strong>Hardman Norns</strong><br>These brutal warrior Norns will try and tackle even the most ferocious Grendel - and they'll probably win too! Their resilient constitution means they'll suffer less from toxin infections than other Norns. They're so very hardy that they prefer to live in the dangerous Jungle Terrarium in Creatures 3. <br>Also included is the Mecha-Grendel toy, a few plants that will add life and more food sources to your Docking Station ship and the Jungle Terrarium, as well as the Calm Balm -  a potion that eases the mind of angry thought for even the most frustrated Hardman Norn.<br></li><li><strong>Treehugger Norns</strong><br>Treehuggers are fragile, Nature-loving Norns that have a strong affinity with plants and animals. They'd rather be alone outside in Nature than cramped up inside with other Norns, and don't gain as much fat from food as other Norns do. Instead, they need to eat edible plants and seeds in order to get the fat they need to survive. <br>Their pack also contains a Cuddly Tree toy, the Panatreea Potion, a Random Teleporter, the Popping Pappus plant and the Quirky Cookie Machine - a fantastic device that can create unique cookies from ingredients found on both the Creatures 3 Ark and the Docking Station Capillata.<br></li><li><strong>Toxic Norns</strong><br>These Norns are so heavily mutated that their main source of food is detritus (rotting things)! Also, they have the rather odd ability of being able to gain nutrition from toxin infections. Toxic Norns provide an extra challenge as their upside-down biochemistry makes it harder for them to breed successfully with other Norns.<br>Their pack comes with a few bugs to entertain and annoy your norns, as well as a variety of agents to take care of the Toxic Norns' special dietary requirements, such as the Cack-in-a-box, the Toxic Trashcan, Macrobacteria and the Stinking Stump Plant.<br></li><li><strong>Banshee Grendels</strong><br> A completely new breed of Grendel with a unique genome which gives them distinctly different behaviour. <br>Also includes the Banshee Egg Stone. Created by the Banshee, this stone reeks of the stench of the Grendel Home. In Docking Station it also seems to form Banshee Grendel eggs out of thin air -- why would it do that, I wonder?</li></ul>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813080/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1640163787","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813080/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1640163787","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813080/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1640163787","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1813080/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1640163787","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Breed Packs</strong><br><br>Following in our series of New Breeds (which are now included in Creatures Docking Station), we released a series of uniquely themed Norn Packs which enhance Docking Station or Creatures 3 with four completely new breeds of Norn and loads of neat agents - everything from weird plants and cool toys to strange gadgets and even stranger bugs and critters.<br><br>Each of these Norn Packs contained one brand new Norn breed and three or more agents that were designed to match the general theme of the pack.
