{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Casual Game Engine!</h2><br>Casual Game Engine is another playground for both gamers and developers. With the game engine you can create your own singleplayer shooter games in 2D in top-down perspective using AngelScript. Games can be made as standalone games, mods and, if desired, shared with Steam (you need an own developer account for that).<br><br>Casual Game Engine utilizes the famous AngelScript scripting language which has its valid place in the game development universe. It is easy to learn and has an easy understandable C++ style syntax. <br><br>Your actual game is implemented by creating custom entities, player behaviour and define maps with custom entities. You can just launch the engine GUI builder, create a new project and everything is generated for you. You then just have to modify the entity source files. We suggest to use VS Code as editor.<br><br>Note that this product is quite oldschool: There is no visual scripting or map editor included yet, so this is preferably suited for developers who like to write code.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1725730/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1698241876","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1725730/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1698241876","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1725730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1698241876","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1725730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1698241876","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome to Casual Game Engine!</h2><br>Casual Game Engine is another playground for both gamers and developers.
