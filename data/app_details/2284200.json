{"about_the_game":"Artificer\u2019s Tower is a cozy colony sim resource management game that features base-building, tower defense systems, and powerful enemies to defeat. You are tasked with building and defending an out-of-this-world tower that would make even Merlin himself proud! Keep your mages happy and your tower safe by building up your tower, gathering resources and crafting everything you might need. Build your tower however you like and unleash your inner architect wizard. It's like Hogwarts, but with more explosions (and less sorting hat drama).<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2284200/extras/fancy-build.png?t=1719243413\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2284200/extras/Steam_-_Build.gif?t=1719243413\" /><br>Are you ready to let your architectural creativity run wild?
