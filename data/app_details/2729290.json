{"about_the_game":"The Delay Engines Bolt-on contains 10 extra delay effect engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChorus is a single-tap delay effect with a modulating delay period. It is typically used to add depth to a sound, to make a single voice sound as though multiple voices are playing at once. To use this effect attach a modulator to the delay parameter. A classic chorus effect would use a triangle or sine wave modulator with a speed of around one millisecond. Note that modulating the Single Tap Delay effect can exactly model a chorus with more flexibility regarding left/right values and larger delay values, though at the expense of more memory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombed Chorus is unique to SFXEngine. This is a chorus effect with six internal delays that can be spread. The effect sounds like something between a chorus and flange and can be useful for robotic sounding vocals. The delay buffers are larger than in a normal chorus effect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEverlooper is a combination of amplitude modulator and eternal delay, this effect allows the easy creation of seamless loops. The principle is that the sound is faded up and down in a ramp, then eternally looped at half of the ramp size to create a cross-fade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlange is a common audio effect related to chorus; a multi tap delay effect that uses a varying delay time. A typical flange is a powerful sweeping sound that is sometimes used on guitars and vocals in pop songs. It can be used to create a wide variety of effects from adding depth to a sound and robotic vocals, to the creation powerful swooping or laser effects. High feedback on the delays can give a high squeak. To use this effect, attach a modulator to the delay parameter. Try applying the effect to white noise or distorted sounds to get the most from the sweep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLong Period Delay is a delay effect, like the Basic Delay, but with a much larger buffer to permit delays of up to 60 seconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLong Single Delay is a single-tap delay effect with a large buffer to permit delays (or pauses) of up to 60 seconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMono Delay is a basic delay effect which mixes and pans the resulting signal. The left and right channel delay taps are combined into a monophonic signal that can be panned. Modulate the pan parameter with a square or rhomboid wave to bounce alternating echoes left and right, or apply more complex modulators to achieve more exotic panning effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMono Single Tap Delay is a basic delay effect which mixes and pans the resulting signal. The left and right channel delay taps are combined into a monophonic signal that can be panned. Modulate the pan parameter with a square or rhomboid wave to bounce alternating echoes left and right, or apply more complex modulators to achieve more exotic panning effects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhaser is a stereo electronic effect which uses a modulating internal delay to create a sweeping sound, sounding like the whoosh of a passing jet engine. The effect is related to chorus, but uses an all-pass filter to enhance certain harmonics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTuned Flange is a flange effect which uses a delay related to the pitch of the note. Useful for adding a tinny robotic sound to real-world effects. Produces interesting effects on breathy sounds.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1734436141","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729290/page.bg.jpg?t=1734436141","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729290/966f749e6183353d9d173557f1924bac13727ea0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1734436141","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2729290/966f749e6183353d9d173557f1924bac13727ea0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1734436141","categories":[{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The Delay Engines Bolt-on contains 10 extra delay effect engines to boost capabilities of SFXEngine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChorus is a single-tap delay effect with a modulating delay period.
