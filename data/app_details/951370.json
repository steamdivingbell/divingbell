{"about_the_game":"Drawkanoid is a neon-drenched love letter to brick breaking games. We took out all the boring bits, like paddles, and turned everything up to 11! The ball moves at hyperspeed, shattering everything into explosion-filled eyecandy. Bullet time lets you react at the speed of thought. Tactically deployable powerups let you decide exactly when to go into full ludicrous mode. Unlock Countdown and Zen modes to up the tension or zone out and smash therapeutically beautiful glowing patterns.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951370/extras/drawkanoid_14-op.gif?t=1580823503\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You've never played something quite like this.</h2>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"I heard you like upgrades","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/d7bbd767987a5891064032f96b67eab8d16539b8.jpg"},{"name":"Neon and chill","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/9853f4c77e3d77b1dadd93c27396aae0f40d90ef.jpg"},{"name":"Come with me if you want to live","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/8d451ee8456912ba6008c27a041f8271f31c93a2.jpg"},{"name":"Meditative","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/7e55afc6e4315f686e2c78d4718ab0014b442eeb.jpg"},{"name":"Full body relaxation","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/480e04a0bf79487c9f4214a770c514f82170dd6e.jpg"},{"name":"Five minutes to midnight","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/0ebcea276f513345f0ad30ac51db5dc24b828651.jpg"},{"name":"FVN sent you","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/41def17de0fd3e7223fe89c340c76845df1abd5f.jpg"},{"name":"Tactical implications","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/1329e019e7d0154fb25548284a294d7b19baa0dc.jpg"},{"name":"4D chess","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/0567a25248803f5aebbb7d1d90c5dffb8d39f7b9.jpg"},{"name":"Bootstrapping","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/951370/fd103539b26ee62139bdc4accd8f3695123c2ec8.jpg"}],"total":25},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951370/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1580823503","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951370/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1580823503","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951370/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1580823503","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/951370/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1580823503","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Drawkanoid is a neon-drenched love letter to brick breaking games.
