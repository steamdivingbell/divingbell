{"about_the_game":"It is the future; humans have the ability to navigate through space and conquer planets using cloning technology. At some point in history, humankind disappeared, leaving everything behind: houses, factories, and planets. By chance or fate, one of the abandoned cloning factories starts running again, creating an army of clones with the preconfigured objective of conquering the next planet. However, Death Pilot does not begin at the outset of this conquest. Instead, it unfolds many years into the future, when the cloning factory is no longer in optimal condition because there is nobody around to maintain it. Rather than producing an army of clones, the cloning factory now creates just one clone over the course of years. And that clone is you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Explore the planet</h2>Embark on a journey across the planet to uncover clues about your past clones.
