The challenge was escaping without waking that stranger.<br><br>It was hot, and smelled of sweat and berry lube, inviting Spotlight to stay under the covers, and maybe try for round four. This was the usual choice he faced. But the longer he stayed, the more likely something terrible would happen, like learning the guy\u2019s name. Spotlight lifted the corner of the blanket and slid his foot over the edge, careful not to rustle the mattress.<br><br>The stranger rolled over. Spotlight froze with his leg hanging over the bed\u2019s edge. The guy\u2019s eyes were still closed. Spotlight waited, holding his breath.<br><br>The morning after lacked all the kinkiness of the night before. This was raw, with his naked body coated in sweat and a crust of cum lingering on his cock. He didn\u2019t like being seen like this, especially in the harsh morning light. At night, Spotlight could strut around in his spandex suit, flash a smile, and have his choice of guy (or guys). He knew the best superhero clubs in Edge City, and the goal of everyone there was to get underneath his spandex. Sometimes he\u2019d hook up right at the club, then fly back to his own bed. Every once in a while, he went home with someone. But never to his place. Only theirs. Only with strangers.<br><br>Spotlight inched his butt to the side of the bed and stretched his foot to the cold floor.<br><br>His phone rang.<br><br>The guy grumbled, then yawned. His arms stretched out, pushing the blanket away, revealing a muscular, hairy chest and hairier armpits. His eyes opened. He smiled. \u201cHey there.\u201d<br><br>The phone kept ringing, a steady chime of electronic beeps and boops that resembled a PR firm\u2019s idea of \u201csounding futuristic.\u201d<br><br>A red hue covered the room through the closed blinds. Spotlight struggled to adjust to the dimness. He lifted his finger. The tip glowed a pale white, washing over the dark floor and bringing the previous night\u2019s mess into view. Clothes lined a path from the door to the bed, mostly the other guy\u2019s. A lamp remained on its side. A bookshelf looked like it had survived an earthquake. They\u2019d managed to mess up every surface in the room.<br><br>Under the window sparkled the iridescent spandex of Spotlight\u2019s uniform. His phone lay face down beside it.<br><br>Spotlight jumped from the bed and grabbed his phone with his unlit hand. \u201cHold that thought,\u201d he said, distracted by the guy\u2019s flexing biceps. He extinguished the light from his finger, tapped the screen, then brought it to his ear.<br><br>\u201cSpotlight, baby, how\u2019s my favorite superhero?\u201d His agent. Kenneth Holt.<br><br>Asshole.<br><br>\u201cWork,\u201d Spotlight whispered to his hookup. If this call went on too long, at some point, the guy would start talking. Asking questions. Like what\u2019s his name?<br><br>Whatshisname wrinkled his nose, then rolled onto his back and stretched his arms behind his head. The blanket slipped down, revealing his chiseled abs. Spotlight turned away to avoid temptation.<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he said into the phone.<br><br>\u201cScaffolding collapse on Wackker Dr.,\u201d Kenneth said. \u201cPress is already on their way. Major client owns the building, so avoid any more damage.\u201d<br><br>Spotlight stood naked over his uniform, stiff in all the wrong places. \u201cAnyone hurt?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNah. Just two construction workers stuck on what\u2019s remaining. It\u2019ll be a quick photo op, then get to the office. New sponsors I want you to meet.\u201d<br><br>Photo ops. That was how he spent his time as a superhero\u2014promoting products instead of saving the world.<br><br>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fire department?\u201d Spotlight asked.<br><br>\u201cThey don\u2019t have investors to keep happy.\u201d Kenneth\u2019s acerbic tone stung through the phone. \u201cSave the day, then get over here.\u201d<br><br>Spotlight bit his lip, holding back what he wanted to say. Future Industries had funded his superhero lifestyle for almost five years now. He had a contract. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d<br><br>\u201cTen,\u201d Kenneth said. \u201cChannel 6 is already there.\u201d<br><br>Spotlight sighed. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy,\u201d Kenneth said. \u201cGive \u2018em a good show.\u201d<br><br>Spotlight tossed the phone on the bed and turned away.<br><br>\u201cThe world\u2019s not ending, is it?\u201d the guy asked.<br><br>\u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d Spotlight reached down for his uniform.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re my first superhero.\u201d The guy posed on his side, letting the blanket drape seductively over his waist and leg. \u201cI\u2019m up for another go. Especially with you showing off like that.\u201d<br><br>Spotlight stared at the hunk, inviting him back into that warm bed. The spandex uniform draped between his fingers, so light it barely registered as weight.<br><br>There were hundreds of superheroes in this city. Any one of them could deal with this situation better than he could. Firefighters, police, someone with a tall ladder. The only reason Spotlight got the call was because he was under contract\u2013the lackey for a large corporation looking to engender some goodwill by sponsoring the \u201cSuperhero from the Future.\u201d Guarantee a brighter future by casting a spotlight on it. Groan.<br><br>\u201cSorry,\u201d Spotlight said, looking down at his bare feet. \u201cCan\u2019t now.\u201d He tapped the button on the waist of his uniform. The fabric glowed, then expanded around his legs, up his waist and torso, and reached out over his arms. Blue and silver covered his body, clinging to his muscles and molding to his body. Goggles appeared over his eyes and metal bands wrapped around his wrists.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s fucking hot,\u201d the guy said, featuring a hard-on between his spread open legs. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me about my future yet\u2026\u201d He crawled across the bed and reached for Spotlight\u2019s spandex covered bulge. His fingers traced the clear outline of his shaft, tightening the fabric enough to leave little to the imagination. He squeezed the spandex, sliding up along the silky surface, leading to unwanted excitement underneath. The guy\u2019s lips came forward, open and eager. If they made contact, Spotlight knew he would be caught in their trap.<br><br>\u201cQuick,\u201d Spotlight said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to save the day.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou know what this mouth can do,\u201d the guy said. \u201cI can\u2019t let you leave without another taste.\u201d<br><br>To be continued\u2026the full book coming this fall!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501990/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1696514208","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501990/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1696514208","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501990/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1696514208","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2501990/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1696514208","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,3,4,5],"notes":"This is an adult gay romance novel.
