{"about_the_game":"Two sides, two crystals. The side that destroys the enemy crystal wins. Defend yourself with everything that is available to you. Hire mercenaries by placing them on your territory. Install saws to destroy the enemy. Be careful, the enemy also has something to answer with. They can win with crowd or quality. Some create their own copies after death, some attack near, some from afar.
