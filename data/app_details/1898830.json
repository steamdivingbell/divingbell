{"about_the_game":"VBridger allows VTubers to use face tracking to it's fullest potential<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVBridger allows for the augmentation of tracking data, allowing users to combine, mix, and modify live data for use with VTuber Avatars. It comes with several base settings and samples for different types of models. If you have a standard live2D model, you can use our VTS Compatible settings to enhance the tracking quality. If you have a model rigged for ARKit using our parameter guide, you will be able to use our ARKit settings for advanced expression control. If you have an ARKit compatible VRM model, you can use VMC to send tracking data, allowing you to use input curves to tune and calibrate the tracking to better fit your face. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the VBridger - Editor DLC, riggers can unlock the full potential of VBridger and their rigs by gaining the ability to create new outputs and custom controls for their models.
