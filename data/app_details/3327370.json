{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Apricity is a top-down shooter designed to be played with friends.\u00a0</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Heat System</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">What sets Apricity apart is it's Heat system. When you deal damage, you build Heat, and at 100% Heat you become HOT, increasing your attack speed. After a few seconds of not dealing damage, your Heat drops to 0 almost instantly. Reloading (reloading is just the term for a special action, you can fire your primary weapon infinitely) conserves Heat and recharges your abilities, unless you are injured, in which case your Heat is expended to rapidly heal you.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Importantly, enemies drop orbs on death that heal you and recharge your abilities, often forcing players into a choice: do I back off and reload, or just keep shooting and hope I can heal from the orb?</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classes</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Apricity has 11 character classes.
