{"about_the_game":"<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is a game set in a confined space with permanent death that keeps you on edge every second. In this dynamic world, you are forced to constantly move, search for keys to locked rooms, and find ways to escape. To survive, the player must use potions with various effects\u2014from damaging potions to buffs\u2014but their supply is limited, and every decision can be fatal. Each room presents new challenges, and permanent death forces you to think through every move carefully.
