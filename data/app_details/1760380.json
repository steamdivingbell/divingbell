It was to protect individual giant cities covering almost the entire planet from armed conflicts. Different cities have different policies towards their citizens. In West Ulrage, every citizen gets a guardian robot at birth. In Hal'Tor, pairs of robots raise several children each. Whereas in Dievez, people are raised in large centers.
