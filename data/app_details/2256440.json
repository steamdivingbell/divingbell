{"about_the_game":"You are still the one and only Captain Johnny &quot;Jimbo Baby&quot; McGibbits, The Infiltrator. It seems like only yesterday that your daring heroics left the Mad Leader in ruins, nipping his plans for world domination in the bud.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut intelligence reports indicate that the Mad Leader has risen from the smoldering ashes in which you left him. Once again, the world is in peril and only you-world-class sprinter, aerospace engineer, consultant to every free-world leader of the last two decades, and ace helicopter pilot-can stop the Mad Leader. Too bad; it looks like you'll have to postpone the christening of the USS McGibbits and that little soiree you had planned with Vanna this evening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter all, you'll be busy flying your Gizmo DHX-1 Attack Chopper behind enemy lines in search of the Mad Leader's new headquarters. Once there, you'll begin an all-new series of ground missions to thwart the Mad Leader's revitalized troops. But be careful! This time, the Mad Leader knows who he's up against!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing:<br />\r\n- Three completely new ground missions<br />\r\n- Realistic helicopter flight simulation<br />\r\n- Great graphics and sound<br />\r\n- A new challenge in this follow-up to the best-selling INFILTRATOR<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\n- Interactive flight simulation: Fly through hostile skies as you attempt to distinguish friend from foe. Guess the correct password or get blown out of the sky.<br />\r\n- Infiltrate the enemy base: Make your way through the enemy base. Keep your ID card ready and a can of sleep gas handy. <br />\r\n- Discover Secret Files: Investigate the enemy hideout. Avoid guards, don disguises, and find the enemy secrets. <br />\r\n- Get out before the enemy gets you.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256440/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1679599337","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256440/page.bg.jpg?t=1679599337","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256440/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1679599337","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2256440/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1679599337","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"You are still the one and only Captain Johnny &quot;Jimbo Baby&quot; McGibbits, The Infiltrator.
