{"about_the_game":"Add new warriors, mages, priests, and even circus performers into your game with the RPG Character Pack 11! Gee-kun-soft is here with another set of MZ characters, this time offering 16 new options for 8 general classes each with a male and female option. Have your heroes be healed by a kind blue-haired priestess or black-haired priest who\u2019s annoyed with how often he sees your heroes in this church, learn new spells from an old bearded sage, battle a sneaky (and shirtless) assassin, and more with this pack!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach characters comes with a character sprite, MZ-style downed poses, a SV battler, faceset with 8 emotions, matching bust images, and 13 static enemy battlers with different color variations so you can face off against friends-turned-foes or gain new party members by defeating them in a battle of wits! Duel a tophat-wearing juggler to earn his respect and have him join the party with his bag of tricks, or chat with a cheery lilac-haired bunny girl to start a side quest to rescue her precious pet rabbit. Fill your team with muscular men like the sturdy martial artist and the serious warrior, or lean into youth with an ageless elf wizard cloaked in dark robes and a brunette adventurer who looks like he may have been pulled from a modern high school into a fantastical world!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack also includes high-res versions of each character\u2019s art so you can scale it to perfectly for your game.
