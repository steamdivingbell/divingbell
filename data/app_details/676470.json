This freedom to walk makes it easy to forget that the play area is bound to only a small 2.5m x 2.5m space. For an even greater, engaging experience, the game asymmetrically includes all friends outside VR and challenges them to direct the person in VR using a map of the maze. <br><br>The game was designed and created as an experiment of VR self-overlapping architectures and local low-budget social VR.
