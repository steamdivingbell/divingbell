The difficulty of waves increases as you progress. To survive you will need to build  a maze of defences using the precious Trash you collect by destroying mobs. These defences could be elemental auto-turrets (towers), unlocked with Gems at Grupy's store, or path traps like Hot Spikes that will damage any mobs that move over them.      <br> <br> Improve your towers after each battle at Grupy's shop. Improve with Trash, Gems and Christmas Cards. These resources are collected during missions and will accumulate globally. Finishing each map economically is extremely beneficial as this will mean starting the next map with more resources. In addition, any extra trash you collect on a mission can later be used to modifiy the stats of your favorite towers.

Mobs can even be 'duped' by forcing them down a long path and then blocking the end. Doing so will cause mobs to backtrack and find an alternate route.

The main benefit of larger towers is they are able to shoot further but they also gain increased projectile size, speed,  and attack power.
