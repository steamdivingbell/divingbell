It was a place of wondrous beauty and dark enigmas, where the brightest hopes danced with the deepest fears in an eternal ballet.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Dreamweavers</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3546770/extras/media-header-dreamweaver2.png?t=1740666646\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Dreamscape is ruled by the <strong>Dreamweavers</strong>, beings of immense power who could shape the ethereal substance of this land to craft realities as one would weave tapestries. Each Dreamweaver held dominion over their aspect of dreams... four factions, embodying the myriad facets of this boundless realm.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Dreamweaver Mechanic</u>:</strong> Dreamscape cards are unique and powerful cards that temporarily change the mechanics of the arena/game board (the Dreamscape) during that match.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Lucid Dreams</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong>Lucid Dreams</strong> were architects of enlightenment, conjuring cities of crystal and spires of light, where knowledge flowed like water, and wisdom bloomed like an endless spring. Their lands were a canvas for the curious and the wise, a utopia where thought and reality were one.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Night Terrors</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Opposing them were the <strong>Night Terrors</strong>, sovereigns of the shadowy recesses of fear. They carved their kingdoms in the chasms and canyons where light dared not linger. Here, the landscape itself responded to the primal fears etched into the very soul of all beings, creating a domain of power for those who thrived in the dark.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Fantasy Dreams</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Amidst these two stood the <strong>Fantasy Dreams</strong>, guardians of the mystical and the mythical. Theirs was a world of verdant forests and shimmering lakes, where mythical beasts roamed wild and free. The air was thick with magic, and every leaf and stone resonated with ancient spells.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Prophetic Dreams</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong>Prophetic Dreams</strong> were the seers and the sages, holders of the keys to destiny. They lived in a serene expanse where time ebbed and flowed like the tide, revealing the past and future in the ripples. Their visions shaped the Dreamscape, as they saw beyond the veil of the present into the myriad paths of what was yet to come.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A New Evil Arises...</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3546770/extras/media-header-morpheus2.png?t=1740666646\" /></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In harmony, these factions maintained the balance of the Dreamscape, until the arrival of the <strong>Nightmares</strong>\u2014corruptions of fears that grew too powerful, too vivid. They were not bound to any realm but roamed the Dreamscape, turning dream into dread, and hope into despair.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">A prophecy whispered among the Dreamweavers spoke of a time when the boundaries between the Dreamscape and the waking world would thin to a gossamer veil, and the Nightmares would seek to break through, to turn all of reality into an eternal nightmare.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Now, the Dreamweavers must rally, harnessing the essence of their domains, to weave a new fate\u2014one that stands against the encroaching darkness of the Nightmares. They must delve into the deepest corners of imagination, conjure the most potent of dreams, and wield the power of legends yet to be written.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Thus begins the saga of <strong>Dreamscape Legends</strong>, where every card played is a dream conjured, and every match is a battle for the soul of both the Dreamscape and the waking world. Will the Dreamweavers maintain the delicate balance, or will the Nightmares consume all in their path? The tapestry of fate is in your hands, dreamer. Weave well, Dreamweaver.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><u>Nightmare Mechanic</u>:</strong> Nightmare cards introduce chaos into the match. They have powerful effects that can have detrimental effects on your opponent... or you. However, players can't play nightmare cards. These cards are randomly placed into each player's deck at the beginning of a match. When a player draws a nightmare card, it is played immediately and automatically.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Note from the Developer:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">I am a full-time AI developer (in the cybersecurity industry) and part-time independent game developer.
