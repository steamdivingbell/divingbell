You will meet and group with hundreds of Erenshor's<i><strong> SimPlayers</strong></i> - which are AI-driven* players who persistently exist in the world, who progress independently, and who will always be ready to group and adventure along side you whenever you're ready.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The <strong><i>SimPlayers</i></strong><i> </i>all have their own personalities and motivations, and their own opinions of you and of the other players. You'll find favorites, and together you'll conquer the world of Erenshor one rare drop at a time.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Players will spend dozens or even hundreds of hours working on their characters. By the time they've reached the end game they'll be carrying godly weapons, long-lost spells, and legendary armor into battle - where they'll be nearly untouchable for all but the most fearsome opponents in Erenshor. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2382520/extras/combatgif2.gif?t=1737211586\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2382520/extras/SPADV.png?t=1737211586\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Erenshor is built from the ground up to be a single player experience.
