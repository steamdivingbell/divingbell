{"about_the_game":"Year 2647. You are an aspiring Robot Glory businessman who has saved enough money<br />\r\nto open his own robot development business. To do this, you have bought a suitable planet<br />\r\nto build your own factory. But space is very harsh, it is inhabited by many<br />\r\npirates who plunder unprotected planets. For this reason, you will need to protect <br />\r\nprotect your base from regular pirate attacks with the help of military robots. And for the production of robots<br />\r\n, you will need to buy planets with valuable resources on which mining robots will work. <br />\r\nWhy do you need to buy planets, you ask? Because this is the year 2647, not 3647, you don't have the technology<br />\r\nto explore very distant planets, and all nearby planets have already sold out all the factions. <br />\r\nRepair robots will be useful to maintain the efficiency of your plant. <br />\r\nWithout them, all your workshops will bend and safely self-destruct. <br />\r\nIt is the repairmen who build and maintain the condition of the workshops. <br />\r\nYou will regularly receive new tasks from which you can choose the right one for you.<br />\r\nBut I warn you, at the beginning of the game, it's better not to take on tasks right away, but first build the necessary workshops,<br />\r\nassemble military robots, repairmen and miners, arrange the delivery of resources, and then follow the circumstances.<br />\r\nI wish you success and become a millionaire!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout the game:<br />\r\nA game in the genre of management strategy. Here you can build your own factory for the production of robots,<br />\r\nand on another planet, and extract resources and test robots on other different planets. <br />\r\nThere is no specific goal in the game, but to develop your factory (or base) you will be able to, <br />\r\nonly by completing various tasks, receiving money as a reward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow to play?<br />\r\nPerhaps the game will cause some difficulties for an unprepared player, so in this tutorial I will try to clearly explain the essence of the game and explain the basics. The goal in the game is to produce more and more cool robots. And so, at the beginning of the game you will have a repair shop and one repairman (who is not attached to the repair shop so that you can always build workshops), as well as 1 drill that is not attached to any planet. According to the standard, the efficiency of repairmen, miners and the military is equal to one, which is very small. You can increase the efficiency of repairmen, miners and the military in the &quot;robots&quot; tab, in the same section you can go to the assembly of robots for the task. Do not confuse the development of robots for tasks and for personal use, since in tasks you may be asked to assemble a military, miner or repairman. Therefore, for tasks, you click the &quot;Build for a task&quot; button, and you assemble the rest for yourself. In the &quot;Maintenance&quot; tab there are buildings that are necessary for the operability of your database. The assembly shop is an important component, without it you will not be able to assemble any robot. The repair shop increases the number of available repair robots that build workshops and repair them. If repairmen are not attached to the workshop, then over time it will collapse. The military workshop increases the number of military robots that are produced in the event of an attack on the base. Attacks on the base occur regularly every few days. The damage inflicted on pirates depends on the effectiveness of your military robots. The Components tab contains all the necessary workshops for the production of various components for assembling the robot. The most important of them are the case and processor, without them it is impossible to test or produce robots. Equally important are the means of transportation \u2014 wheels or limbs. The characteristics of the robot and the presence of certain components affect the success of testing. Each workshop can be improved by increasing the percentage of quality or by adding a conveyor (the conveyor increases the production speed). All workshops included in the production affect the final quality and production time of the robot. A workshop involved in production cannot be improved, destroyed, suspended. If you want the workshop not to participate in production, just suspend its operation before assembling the robot. If the workshop involved in the production is destroyed during the production of robots, then all production will be interrupted and you will have to start over. Also, all workshops regularly charge for maintenance, so the more workshops you have, the more you pay. In the Resources tab, you can configure resource extraction by selecting a mining planet, a mining location, and also buy more drills. You can earn money by completing tasks. In the &quot;Tasks&quot; tab, you can select any one task. The difficulty of tasks increases with the level of your factory. At the beginning of the game, I advise you to first build the necessary workshops, assemble military robots, repairmen and miners and set up resource extraction, and then take on tasks. You can lose in one case \u2014 if you run out of money. The game is saved automatically. That's it.
