For example, in Africa, the scene will have native structures, animals and objects. It will also have a soundtrack that fits the scene, which is fun and enhances the atmosphere of each of the locations. Graphically the game looks good and the soundtrack is great too. It\u2019s easy to play in regards to the controls, and of course the story is fun!\u201d<br>7/10 \u2013 zeepond<br>","screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_c95afe0d0fbf6d0e4948a4d430ef42680b7f2718.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734370563","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_c95afe0d0fbf6d0e4948a4d430ef42680b7f2718.600x338.jpg?t=1734370563"},{"id":1,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_9d55119642e74792d82fc33f6458b6c03967498e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734370563","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_9d55119642e74792d82fc33f6458b6c03967498e.600x338.jpg?t=1734370563"},{"id":2,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_186a9f395680fd8aa2c07ca0644bbdc08153116c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734370563","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_186a9f395680fd8aa2c07ca0644bbdc08153116c.600x338.jpg?t=1734370563"},{"id":3,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_2749255d7265a550b28b3607c2505c6f0c21366b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734370563","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_2749255d7265a550b28b3607c2505c6f0c21366b.600x338.jpg?t=1734370563"},{"id":4,"path_full":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_c6b5f26f16162079e12576e6de51457d97fe9ae4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1734370563","path_thumbnail":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/736860/ss_c6b5f26f16162079e12576e6de51457d97fe9ae4.600x338.jpg?t=1734370563"}],"short_description":"You will travel round the world with the Jules Verne heroes!
