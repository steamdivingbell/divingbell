{"about_the_game":"Use Your Brain! is a a mindbending take on the blockbreaker genre of games where you have to control a paddle (textbook) on all four sides of the screen to successfully destroy the blocks with your ball (brain).

Will you forget to move the left/right textbook while focusing on the top/bottom direction? Will you over use the left and right brain boosts to your own demise?
