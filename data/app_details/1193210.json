{"about_the_game":"Hunt the Muglump is a retro-inspired dungeon crawling adventure where you must brave the dangers of a dark dungeon in order to slay the Muglump by shooting it with an arrow.  The Muglump is a horrific, greedy beast that can and will consume anything and anyone it can get its hands on.  Along the way watch out for bottomless pit traps and giant bats that can carry you to other parts of the dungeon that may lead to certain doom.  To play the game, players must explore the dungeon.  When they enter a room, they will receive on screen messages indicating if danger is close.  Using these clues, they must determine if one of the nearby rooms contains a muglump and fire an arrow into it, slaying the beast.  After slaying all muglumps in the dungeon, players should return to the entrance to successfully complete the game.<br><br>Features include:<br>  <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Randomized map generation on each playthrough.  Never visit the same dungeon twice!<br></li><li> An original, addicting, retro-inspired soundtrack<br></li><li> Turn the dials on the dungeon generation algorithm to create your own custom dungeon in Custom Mode.<br></li><li> Download the Hunt the Muglump soundtrack for free when you purchase Hunt the Muglump.
