There are boundless expanses of outer space around. Feel what the cosmic scale really is.<br />\r\nFlying in space is a real test for a pilot. Huge overloads will push in all directions. You will have to maneuver correctly to gain an advantage over the enemy and win, and not lose sight and be destroyed.<br />\r\nA fully clickable cockpit allows you to better immerse yourself in the process of controlling a fighter.<br />\r\nThe Newtonian physics of flight is reproduced with maximum accuracy, which allows for orbital flights and maneuvering.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725088167","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080490/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725088167","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725088167","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725088167","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Close the cockpit of your fighter, start the engine and take off.
