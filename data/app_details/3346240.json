{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i><u>Reverie Shift</u></i></strong> is a surreal adventure that challenges everything you know about reality. You awaken with no memory of who you are, how you got there, or even your age, and your only companion is a mysterious voice that both guides and deceives you. As you traverse through bizarre worlds where the laws of physics and time are constantly shifting, you\u2019ll encounter a series of strange and disorienting environments, each with its own set of rules. As you explore further, the boundaries between dreams, reality, and illusion blur. Each decision you make, each door you open, brings you closer to the truth\u2014or further into confusion. In Reverie Shift, there are no clear answers, only mysteries to unravel and puzzles to solve as you try to uncover who you really are and what your purpose is in this strange, ever-changing world. Will you trust the voice that guides you, or will you take control and discover the truth on your own?</p>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3346240/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1737193833","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3346240/page.bg.jpg?t=1737193833","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3346240/46b3ae16a9553416e0f1c1007821d4a5b4ad2bb8/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1737193833","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3346240/46b3ae16a9553416e0f1c1007821d4a5b4ad2bb8/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1737193833","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong><i><u>Reverie Shift</u></i></strong> is a surreal adventure that challenges everything you know about reality.
