{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2> Starfinder RPG - Starfinder Society #1-13 On the Trail of History<br> <br> A Starfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 3-6. <br> Now possessing key information about the mysteries of the Scoured Stars, the Starfinder Society sends the PCs to a distant star system in the Vast. The idea that the non-spacefaring natives of this system have any connection with the distant Scoured Stars seems unlikely, but it's up to the PCs to confirm if a connection does exist. Other factions complicate the situation by having their own unique agendas relating to the distant world and its peaceful inhabitants. <br> Content in\u00a0On the Trail of History\u00a0also contributes to the ongoing goals of the Second Seekers (Luwazi Elsebo) faction.
