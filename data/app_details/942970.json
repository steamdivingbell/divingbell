Since a 'different' has an underlying meaning of &quot;indefinite&quot;, this project means a whole new challenge for us to fuse splendid storytelling and puzzle solving together. We are definitely appreciated all your understanding and we believe that Unheard has the potential and capacity to flourish a new way to experience stories of other genres more than mystery in the near future in your supporting.<br><br>There are five chapters with full Chinese and English voices in the first version, and meanwhile we are planning to make a free DLC in a couple of months to update.<br><br><strong>Please feel free to comment and get in touch with us!</strong> We would like to check and read every feedbacks from time to time.
