{"about_the_game":"This DLC contains one Hunter and two Weapons:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- The Kid (Hunter)<br />\r\n- Ash (Conversion)<br />\r\n- Ember (Conversion)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Abaddon boy was a troublemaker. Pickpocket from the time he was five years old, and no surprise coming from a family like that. A moonshine family. A gambling family. Weren\u2019t nobody attended one of their poker games that went home with anything left in their pocket. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTurner was the youngest of the eight, and a runt at that. Had a chip on his shoulder, and something to prove. Quick to pick a fight, and just as quick to run off - that is until he got so good at shooting that people started whispering he\u2019d made some kind of dark deal. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWas a shame what happened to his siblings though. Ember and Ash, they were called. Figures, seeing as they burned up inside the shack the ten of them lived packed into. All the others made it out. God marked them for the fire with names like that. Turner named his pistols after them. Said every shot was to remind him of them. Keep their memory alive. But I heard it was Turner who started the fire in the first place. Memory, guilt, loyalty. They\u2019re funny things out here in the Bayou. Have a way of getting all twisted up into something sinister. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTurner still acts like he has a lot to prove, but these days, he has the skill to prove it, especially with those two Caldwell Conversion Pistols at his sides. Wouldn\u2019t recommend partnering up with him, but wouldn\u2019t recommend underestimating him either. Not anymore. The runt come back to roost.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1720670/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728562470","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1720670/page.bg.jpg?t=1728562470","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1720670/d2d9c790ddff83cf2048667df02b667d70c7b60d/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728562470","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1720670/d2d9c790ddff83cf2048667df02b667d70c7b60d/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728562470","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter and two Weapons:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- The Kid (Hunter)<br />\r\n- Ash (Conversion)<br />\r\n- Ember (Conversion)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Abaddon boy was a troublemaker.
