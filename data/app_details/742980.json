{"about_the_game":"Hundreds of thousands of cats roam the metropolis of Istanbul freely. For thousands of years they\u2019ve wandered in and out of people\u2019s lives, becoming an essential part of the communities that make the city so rich. Claiming no owners, these animals live between two worlds, neither wild nor tame \u2013 and they bring joy and purpose to those people they choose to adopt. In Istanbul, cats are the mirrors to the people, allowing them to reflect on their lives in ways nothing else could.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/742980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1552671061","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/742980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1552671061","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/742980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1552671061","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/742980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1552671061","categories":[{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Native Steam Controller Support","id":33}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<h1>Steam Video</h1><p>This content is only available in an online streaming format.
