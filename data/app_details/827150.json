{"about_the_game":"This bundle contains the Hunter AFV, 5 Platinum Loot Crates, 1.000 Gold and 14 days of Premium Time. In Armored Warfare, the Hunter AFV is a Tier 9 Premium Armored Fighting Vehicle. As its description above suggests, it is a rather standard-sized IFV with good levels of protection and excellent firepower (consisting of a 30mm autocannon and a Spike ATGM launcher). It also features a recently introduced type of armor, NERA. Simply put, NERA is an ablative armor kit that deteriorates whenever it gets hit. In other words, the vehicle starts with excellent protection levels but it will lose some with damage taken as the battle progresses. Apart from that, the vehicle is adequately mobile and quite universal. It can, of course, also deploy Mechanized Infantry.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1685965325","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827150/page.bg.jpg?t=1685965325","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827150/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1685965325","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/827150/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1685965325","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Turn Notifications","id":32}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"This bundle contains the Hunter AFV, 5 Platinum Loot Crates, 1.000 Gold and 14 days of Premium Time.
