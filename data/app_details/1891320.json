{"about_the_game":"iDentity Rebels is an open world RPG looter shooter currently in development.  Set in a semi-futuristic post-apocalyptic environment which is ruled by the Regime, a totalitarian Government.  Commanded with oppression and violence within a city surrounded by walls heavily surveyed.  The Regime forces its citizen to conform to the new way of living.  You are a Rebel, one who does not conform to societal norms.  Those who resist and rise against oppression at all costs, firmly identifying with who you are. Residing in the wasteland where you will find perilous environments to explore, merciless enemies and abominate creatures.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE CAMPAIGN</h2><br>Upon release of the full game you can go at it solo or with a team of 4, you will play several strategic missions specifically geared towards reclaiming the city and liberating its citizens.  The wasteland offers its own experiences with hidden dungeons and underground pathways.  Also, with a cataclysmic event consequently cultivating hazard zones far more dangerous than the wasteland itself.  Where the loot is in abundance and the risk is high!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE GEAR</h2><br>When starting the full game, you can create your own character and choose from an array of gear from the Ultratech armament.  An amalgamation of armor and weaponry with technology that has surpassed modern tech by decades.  An abilities system that does not confine you to one single playstyle but many.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER</h2><br>Once iDentity Rebels is complete you will be able to Compete against opposite teams in PVP with numerous game modes.  Here you can showcase your builds against others with unique gear, abilities and playstyles<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">AWESOME REPLAYABILITY</h2><br> The looter shooter genre itself offers replayable content due to the obsessive nature of the loot grind for the best gear.  But aside from that, iDentity Rebels has many avenues of replayability.  From the wasteland to the missions, to multiplayer modes and the very many build combinations to explore with Ultratech.  This game will have you always wanting more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1891320/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728176720","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1891320/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728176720","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1891320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728176720","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1891320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728176720","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"The mature content will mainly feature Gun violence and oppression of a totalitarian Government."},"detailed_description":"iDentity Rebels is an open world RPG looter shooter currently in development.
