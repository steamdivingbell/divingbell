{"about_the_game":"Erectus is a straight forward board game with one goal: get your pawn to the other side of the board first. The catch is, both you and your opponent can place walls to limit movement across the grid. Take turns with your opponent moving your pawn or placing a wall. Be careful, the walls you place can block your path, too!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note before buying: at this time only local multiplayer is supported. There is no AI for single-player gameplay, nor is there an option to play against opponents online. These features may be implemented in the future, but most likely as a sequel/remake.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979060/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1657307381","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979060/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1657307381","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979060/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1657307381","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1979060/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1657307381","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Erectus is a straight forward board game with one goal: get your pawn to the other side of the board first.
