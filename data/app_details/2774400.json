After some failed experiments and unexpected developments, a dangerous virus has taken over the island. With a dozen people left on the island, you will embark on a struggle to escape from the island. You need to meet your basic needs to survive, and there are many new skills you need to learn to become stronger. As you build relationships with people, your initially uncertain situation gradually becomes clearer and clearer as you find your way off the island.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the gameplay</h2><br>With the experience points you gain from killing zombies, completing missions or crafting things, you can activate new abilities from the skill tree and become much stronger with these new abilities.<br><br>Use the crafting table to craft new items for yourself, either to increase your protection or to craft new weapons to increase your attack power.<br><br>Remember that zombies get stronger and more aggressive at night, so you may need to spend the night in a safe place.
