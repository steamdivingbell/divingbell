Difficulty and balance scale with the number of players in a match. One player becomes The Reaper, a terrifying killer, while the others become Residents of the town The Reaper terrorizes. Residents are assigned unique roles, granting them special abilities, goals and ways to contribute and help others and themselves. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Reaper has but one concern - to terrorize and kill.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The Residents have a wide variety of objectives and methods of surviving or escaping the match. They can even attempt to turn the tide and kill The Reaper (or die trying).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The town itself offers a sandbox experience, with many locations, activities and side-objectives. The game is designed around player freedom. While other games in the genre often punish players who don't (or can't) engage in teamwork and coordination, Fear The Reaper accomodates all play styles, offering plenty of teamwork opportunities but never forcing it.</p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE ROLES:</strong></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each Resident is assigned a randomly chosen role at the start of the match. You could be THE PROTECTOR for instance - you load into the match with a shotgun and extra ammo. Any player in need of help is highlighted to you. You can be the hero... or choose to be selfish and keep the shotgun for yourself. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">There are 8 unique roles so far, with THE FINAL GIRL being the most important one. If chosen, you are the &quot;main character&quot; of the match. The other Residents are encouraged to keep you alive, while the Reaper attempts to locate and eliminate you.
