{"about_the_game":"&quot; <br>   <br>  <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> <br>  The Divine Alligator  </h2>   <br>  Another\u00a00\u00a0one Games <br>  <br>  classic in a brand new edition for Pathfinder RPG. Venture again in the lizardfolk settlement and face Tannin and his minions, if you dare! <br>  Two hundred years ago was the time of Raerciminar, a dragon furthering the agenda of Itzquizatl, a draconic deity of death and decay. His chief method was infusing as many creatures as possible with dragon blood. Leaving several dozen half-dragon children in his wake, Raerciminar retreated into his distant lair and slumbered into deep sleep, waiting for his children to reach maturity by themselves and instruct them later. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br> <strong> <br>  Stunning artwork by Daniele Bigliardo  </strong> <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> <strong> The Divine Alligator</strong> is an old-style Pathfinder adventure for 7th level (scalable to 5-6th and 8-9th) characters<br>  A ranger or druid is highly helpful, as is someone with good Diplomacy and Knowledge (religion) skills, plus the ability to speak Draconic. Characters of higher or lower levels can also take part in the adventure.  <br>  <br>  This adventure was designed to challenge both combat-lovers and in-depth roleplayers. It is a combination of site-based and event-driven adventure types. There are a lot of monsters to fight and trinkets to gain, but complete success in <br> <strong> The Divine Alligator</strong> requires good diplomatic skills and a deal of good judgment.
