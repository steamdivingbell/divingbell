{"about_the_game":"In <i><strong>Otto's Escape</strong></i> you fly a jetpack with just two buttons: one for your left booster and one for your right. There's no simple move up or move right button - that'd be too easy. To steer, you'll need to balance the thrust from those two boosters to get you moving in the right direction, all while fighting with gravity and an ever-shrinking fuel supply.<br><br>The aim of the game is simple: reach the top of the tower and escape without running out of fuel, or you'll be sent right back to the ground.
