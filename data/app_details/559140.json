{"about_the_game":"We\u2019ve all dealt with pinheads.  They are everywhere and you have to be polite to them.  I mean, I don\u2019t want to sound like a jerk.  I know they mean well\u2026at least most of them.  They know not just what pinheads they can be.  How nice would it be to be able to throw bowling balls at them.  Well, here is your chance!  And its legal!  You can throw bowling balls at these pinheads all day long.  Some of them will even like it.  Not only the pinheads at the end of the lane, but also the rest of the pinheads taking up space.  As long as you are playing this game, you\u2019ll never have to be polite to any pinhead you see.
