They not only provide the wearer with the confidence that comes from mimicking the warrior of the gods, the paint holds the core of the gods strength within it.

They are also good for intimidating any enemies that may cross your path.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/313850/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447362680","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/313850/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447362680","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/313850/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447362680","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/313850/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447362680","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Forge Pathfinder VIP Pack</strong><br>To Celebrate the release of Teams in Forge we are offering all the Armor you need to intimidate your opponents when playing the Pathfinder including the Sun Armor, the Bivrust Armor, and the infamous Bardajalmor Helm.
