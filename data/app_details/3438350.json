Luckily, the flash beacon is here to fix all your problems. Only problem is, the more it's used, the more power gets drained each flash. Don't know why (this place is ancient).</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">After you're done for the night, the main power comes back on, shutting the doors until the next night arrives.

Some attack you directly, others only move when the cameras are down, and some of them even try to sabotage your resources, causing you to have to turn around and reset your systems.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Like the sequel, <strong>this game was made in Scratch</strong> using Turbowarp, packaged with Electron.
