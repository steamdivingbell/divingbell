But a curious thing happens when its eye closes, the world disappears around you and anything brightly lit up leaves an afterimage burned into the vision of the Eye. To you, these afterimages are solid objects, and you can jump on them to get to unreachable places and accomplish impossible feats. <br><br>Use lights to your advantage when the eye is open. Flip switches, rotate lights, carry lanterns to light up the world, and close the eye to create afterimages where you need them to overcome the many puzzles and challenges in this world.
