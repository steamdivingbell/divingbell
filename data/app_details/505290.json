{"about_the_game":"Super Rock Blasters! is a local multiplayer game inspired by the classic game Asteroids that reworks it into an arena for frantic, chaotic PvP goodness.

However, Quadratron takes no responsibility for what you do after your best friend rams your ship for the umpteenth time.<br></li><li>Classic mechanics, updated for modern sensibilities: Asteroids never looked or felt this good before.<br></li><li>Easy to learn, hard to master: Simple controls and intuitive design allow anyone to pick up the game and have fun, while more experienced players will enjoy figuring out ever more precise maneuvers to blast their opponents with.<br></li><li>AI opponents: Missing a few friends?
