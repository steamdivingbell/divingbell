You assume the role of an enlightened cultist who has glimpsed terrifying truths lying beyond our world. Your objective in the game is to create a cult that extends its tentacles of influence across the globe, worshipping ancient, cosmic deities beyond human comprehension. Undoubtedly, the power of these gods is irresistible, as you will discover as you progress through the game.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2854260/extras/Mhar.gif?t=1725808411\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Unfolding Complexity</strong></h2></li></ul>The adventure begins with simple clicks, but as you delve deeper, the complexity of the game gradually unfolds. Each click is not merely an action, but a step towards expanding the influence of your cult across the world. With each click, you gain new followers, drawn by promises of power and forbidden knowledge. These followers generate gold - the lifeblood of your cult's expansion. Gold can be exchanged for various upgrades and structures, each playing a role in strengthening your position. From temples that increase followers' devotion to secret libraries unlocking forbidden knowledge. However, as your power grows, so does the risk. The strange beings you summon are volatile and unpredictable.

Key mechanics include:<br><strong>Managing Cult Branches:</strong> Construct buildings, place relics, and upgrade your main cultist or summoned entities. These branches are central to your expansion strategy, as they allow you to recruit new cultists and send out expeditions.<br><strong>Expeditions:</strong> Discover new locations and acquire valuable relics that strengthen your cult. The relics you obtain can be used in branches or shrines, spreading their power throughout your domain. <br><strong>Summoning Temple:</strong> Offer prayers to summon various familiars. The type of familiar you summon is entirely up to you. Each new familiar can become a powerful ally in your path to expansion, but remember that this sword may have two edges. <br><strong>Achievement Card System:</strong> Unlock new buffs that enhance your abilities and influence. You can also upgrade your cultist by purchasing various enhancements based on the experience gained in the game. <br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2854260/extras/CThalpaIdle.gif?t=1725808411\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Ultimate Question</strong></h2></li></ul>Will you be able to convince the entire world to worship the ancient gods and ascend to another dimension?
