With constant expansion pushing further into the depths of space, humans conquered everything in their path, led by a dangerous and passionate ambition. At some point that blaze of glory seemed fated to come to an end. A coalition of alien species appeared and attacked, precision so swift and deadly that humanity is not only reminded of the taste of defeat but entirely swallowed by it. We were not prepared and Humanity lost. Based on Norse Vikings, the Varangians are a human faction that is composed of exiled militants and are no longer associated with any other human faction. They are a team of mercenaries without allegiance to any other faction. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWork with other human factions to push off the alien attack by killing aliens, defending humans, collecting items, and building your presence in the galaxy.
