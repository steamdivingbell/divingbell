These upgrades can help you survive longer and longer into a round, but be ready, things really start to ramp up. New weights will begin to spawn just as you think you've gotten the hang of it, and the spawn rate is always speeding up!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was born during the 49th Ludum Dare game jam around the theme of &quot;unstable&quot;.
