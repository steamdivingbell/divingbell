{"about_the_game":"<strong>Enter the decrepit lair of the Dark Mother</strong>, the powerful demon that rules the underworld. Prove yourself a worthy Dungeon Lord by satiating her endless hunger for domination, conquest, and the ultimate eradication of the human race. It is up to you to lead your minions to victory through an array of logistical challenges and brutal skirmishes.<br><br>As Dungeon Lord, your key challenge is to create strong production chains that process the natural underground resources like ore, roots, and coal into useful materials for building rooms and furniture, crafting weapons and armour, or feeding the dark mother for valuable rewards. Cultivate the rich subterranean soil to grow the starchy antroot, used to bake bread and brew beer, and hunt rats and fish for protein to be cooked and served in your bar rooms.<br><br>As more minions join your fray, whether through force or as an offering from the Dark Mother, you must tend to their different needs for food, drinks, relaxation, training and task management. After all, even imps require work-life balance. A healthy and well-rested army is key to defeating your enemies and expanding your base.<br><br>Keeping your base safe from aggressive creatures, monsters and crusading humans is a challenge best met with strong defences, traps, and a lot of sharp blades. Train your forces, equip them with powerful gear, and send them to the surface world to raid and pillage the humans.
