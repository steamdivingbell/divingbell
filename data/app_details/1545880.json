{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Prison</h2>Explore six puzzle-packed floors and help Herman and his friends contact the outside world! Each floor is filled with puzzles, an exit, and some special rooms. As you puzzle your way through floors, you'll build up an assortment of consumable tools to help you in your journey. Failure sends you back to the start, but with each attempt the layout of the factory changes completely. You'll need to think on your feet!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1545880/extras/wirebar.png?t=1720245441\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Puzzles</h2>Most rooms in the prison contain an electricity-based puzzle, which you'll need to spend tools in to beat. Each puzzle has many possible solutions that require different tools. You might cut a wire to prevent a bomb box from detonating, set off a bomb yourself to knock down concrete walls, or bait a guard into doing all the work then lead it to its doom in a pit. From pouring water on power supplies to placing a battering ram, you aren't low on options. You will need to use all your wits to find the most appropriate way to escape each room.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1545880/extras/trapdoorbar.png?t=1720245441\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Tools</h2>These tools will be your best friend and your closest ally as you guide Herman to victory.
