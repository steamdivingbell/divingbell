{"about_the_game":"Have you ever wished for the ability to control water? In Water Me you'll do just that! Water Me is an adventure 3D puzzle platformer in which you'll play as a water droplet that can change its state of matter.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Wislist Water Me now</strong></h2><br>Water Me is tailored to balance platforming and puzzle solving, where one depends on the other. The puzzles are designed with the intention of challenging you, but also teaching you new mechanics that you'll later need for the platforming part of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cute Post-Apocalyptic Game</strong></h2><br>The game is set in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world without water, in which you'll play as the last water droplet. Your world is inhabited by the civilization of Dusties, living dust-ball creatures who created you to help save the Mother Plant and their dying world.
