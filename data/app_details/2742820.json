{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who We Are</h2>Hi, let me introduce myself! I\u2019m cat_anon, a solo developer with a lifelong passion for IT and video games. From a young age, I've been captivated by the world of technology and interactive entertainment. Now, I\u2019m thrilled to channel that passion into developing REC, a game that is available to everyone for free! REC is the culmination of my dedication and enthusiasm for creating immersive gaming experiences, and I can\u2019t wait for you to dive in and enjoy what I\u2019ve built.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Playing Style</h2>REC belongs to the new generation of bodycam-style FPS games, aiming to push the boundaries of realism and immersion. This style offers a unique and advanced level of realism, allowing players to experience the action from a first-person perspective as if they are viewing it through a body camera. This approach not only enhances the visual authenticity but also intensifies the overall gaming experience, making every moment in the game feel incredibly lifelike.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">History</h2>Set in a parallel world, REC presents a thought-provoking narrative where Ukraine is universally recognized as a force for good and is heavily supported with advanced weaponry. The story begins with a Russian soldier who uncovers a secret plan designed to ignite a nuclear war, only to be killed immediately after his discovery. Players take on the role of a soldier, viewed through a bodycam, tasked with eliminating enemies in hyper-realistic environments. As you progress, you\u2019ll uncover clues and traces leading to the deeper truth about this alternate reality in Ukraine. The ultimate question is: Can you, as a lone soldier, thwart the impending war?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>The gameplay of REC is characterized by intense and continuous combat scenarios across various maps, each culminating in critical encounters with high command. The game features a sophisticated aiming system with a deadzone mechanic, adding to the realism and challenge of combat. While the primary focus is on delivering a visually striking experience, the combat sequences are designed to be dynamic and engaging. Each map is meticulously detailed, offering unique environments and scenarios that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Prepare for a gripping, visually immersive journey as you fight your way to uncover the truth and prevent a catastrophic war.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WARNING</h2><strong>This game is in no way connected to wars currently going on and has nothing to do with real life politics, the video game is a total fantasy story and makes no reference to real politicians or people, please be sure to distinguish reality from a game!!!</strong>","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2742820/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732141390","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2742820/page.bg.jpg?t=1732141390","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2742820/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732141390","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2742820/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732141390","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"REC is a hyper realistic game containing blood, death, shootings etc... if you are a minor please avoid the game."},"demos":[{"appid":3219510,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who We Are</h2>Hi, let me introduce myself!
