{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Description</strong></h2>'Face the Abyss' is 1 vs 3 PvP game. One player takes on the role of the monster, or 'Stalker', who hunts down the survivors with its powerful psychic abilities. The other three players are the survivors, or 'Crew', who must find a way to escape.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Indoor Chase</strong></h2>The Stalker chases the Crew through a narrow and complex facility, relying on sound and terrain features. The Crew must overcome and utilize the limitations of restricted vision in this complex indoor environment to achieve their goal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Escape scenarios</strong></h2>Escaping the facility won't be simple. The Crew must complete one of the 'escape scenarios' to make their way out. Observe the current situation carefully and figure out the most appropriate way to escape. Cooperate with other Crew members to achieve the goal quickly. Escape the facility before being overwhelmed by the Stalker's abilities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Stalker and Abilites</strong></h2>The Stalker has various abilities at its disposal. Decrease the Crew's sanity with powerful psychic abilities. A Crew member with low sanity is much easier to hunt down. Erode the facility and destroy doors to leave the Crew with nowhere to run.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Crew and Items</strong></h2>The Crew can find plenty of items throughout the facility. Use these itmes wisely to delay the Stalker's pursuit and stay alive. Some items are essential for completing escape scenarios.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726820071","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111800/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1726820071","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111800/b2d907a8d87bdb475062b555a79e7b073c9f4219/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726820071","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3111800/b2d907a8d87bdb475062b555a79e7b073c9f4219/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726820071","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":"This game contains content that may not be appropriate for all ages or may be inappropriate for use in the workplace: frequent violence or general adult content"},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Description</strong></h2>'Face the Abyss' is 1 vs 3 PvP game.
