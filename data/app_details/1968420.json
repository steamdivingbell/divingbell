{"about_the_game":"Catch the Yeti! is a game where you try to catch the hiding yeti. Despite its casual look, it is a serious turn-based puzzle game requiring deep thought.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCatch the Yeti! contains completely new puzzle mechanism!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Yeti can only hide behind snowy trees. If you click a tree to remove snow, the Yeti can no longer hide behind the tree. However, after three turns, the tree reverts back to snowy tree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Yeti is fast and strong, so you can't catch it by merely following it like whack-a-mole game. Trap yeti into a corner using the three trees Yeti cannot cross. Snowy trees are considered connected if they are side by side horizontally or vertically.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter clearing Chapter 1, the rock appears as the new gimmick. Unlike trees which stay un-hide-able for three turns, rocks revert back in only one turn. Can you catch the yeti even in complex maps containing both rocks and trees?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChapter 3 includes snow piles which need to be dug up with a shovel, and Chapter 4 contains tree burrows, which are connected underground. The last Chapter 11 contains complex maps including all gimmicks appeared before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWould you like a 'brain' battle with the cute Yeti? Over 200 puzzle maps are available!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features<br />\r\n- Cute 3D graphics<br />\r\n- Brand new puzzle<br />\r\n- Hard, but fun puzzles requiring deep thought<br />\r\n- 10 new gimmicks<br />\r\n- 200+ puzzles<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeveloper Contact: pinebuddev@gmail.com","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968420/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1663500459","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968420/page.bg.jpg?t=1663500459","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1663500459","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1968420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1663500459","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Catch the Yeti! is a game where you try to catch the hiding yeti.
