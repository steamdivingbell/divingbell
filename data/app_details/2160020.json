The sails limped, the trade winds failed to blow, and the merchant revealed the evil within him. Trapped on still waters, each day of the voyage was marked by new horrors.

A mansion they had dubbed the Sultan\u2019s Palace had been prepared.

Debauchery deafened ears and blinded eyes.  <br><br>It was not long until the wind howled, the port waters boiled, and Alaz prepared herself to greet the merchant in his chamber once again, but with Pride\u2019s Death in her hand. She carefully tore at muscle and flesh, taking his pride, and leaving him bleeding out on his bed. Her dress bloodied, she joined the guests in the main hall to grant them a quick death with the merchant\u2019s precious rifle, Shahmaran. <br><br>When the storm died out in the morning, a river of blood gushed out the Sultan\u2019s Palace into the storm-swept streets. The citizens of New Orleans discovered the bodies piled in the hall. And when puzzled minds started asking questions, Alaz had already spent her first bounty on a weapon she dubbed Sister\u2019s Anguish.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160020/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728565132","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160020/page.bg.jpg?t=1728565132","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160020/b43068bce3094d7e06d6456ba11071cfdb8e6816/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728565132","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2160020/b43068bce3094d7e06d6456ba11071cfdb8e6816/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728565132","categories":[{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on Tablet","id":42},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[2,5],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"This DLC contains one Hunter, two Weapons, and one Tool:<br><br>- The Concubine (Hunter)<br>- Shahmaran (Sparks)<br>- Sister's Anguish (Hand Crossbow)<br>- Pride's Death (Heavy Knife)<br><br><strong><u>The Concubine </u></strong><br>As Alaz\u2019s reputation grew, her past became a bloody fairytale, her present soaked in blood and mud.
