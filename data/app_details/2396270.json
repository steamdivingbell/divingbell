It's also ideal for seasoned jet pilots looking for great value in a well-behaved platform with excellent performance and handling. The full-scale Aermacchi MB-339 was designed and manufactured in the 1970's by Alenia Aermacchi SpA as a military jet trainer and light attack aircraft.  This ARF version has been developed to meet the need for an attractive, easy to fly yet fully aerobatic jet model suitable for 60-85N size turbines. With this first-of-its-kind turbine powered jet model completion level, first time jet pilots get performance and flight versatility with low assembly time. Designed to be an attractive, easy to fly yet fully aerobatic jet, it features lightweight, balsa and plywood construction with carbon fiber reinforcements and is finished in genuine UltraCote\u00ae film that's long lasting and easy to maintain.  Designer and world-class pilot Ali Machinchy created the MB-339 with the right combination of attention to details and flight characteristics that Hangar 9 pilots expect.  The Hangar 9 Aermacchi MB-339 60-85N Turbine 84&quot; ARF model delivers an incredible in-flight experience with amazing durability.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396270/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1710365707","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396270/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1710365707","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396270/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1710365707","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2396270/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1710365707","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"The first Hangar 9 turbine jet is a perfect way for experienced pilots to move into turbine-powered models.
