{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pathfinder RPG - Campaign Setting: Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs</h2><strong> Secrets of the Sands</strong><br>In the heart of the Inner Sea region stretches one of the oldest human empires still standing today: the mighty and mysterious land of pharaohs and pyramids known as Osirion.
