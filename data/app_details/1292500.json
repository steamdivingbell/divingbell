Escape! <br><br>Harvest Island is a story-driven, mysterious, dark, lore-rich adventure with horror and farming elements such as watering crops, collecting live stock produce, befriending wild animals, collecting tidepool critters, and catching fish for the gods. You can discover lots of well-hidden places like a cave behind a waterfall or befriending wild animals that'll take you to new places or finding a randomly placed vending machine in a dark underground, hidden room along the beach. The places are hard to discover because of the maze-like island. Tides impede your adventure so conveniently, your dad always dismisses your curious questions, and your sister finds it odd that things on the island are purposefully hidden with some kind of weird message. You'll need to figure out what's wrong with Harvest Island, why the kids are alone with just their father, and dive deep into the lore of Harvest Island to figure out this mysterious, dark story.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292500/extras/Catch.gif?t=1731685324\" /><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1292500/extras/Offer_gods.png?t=1731685324\" /><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Gods play an important part in Harvest Island.
