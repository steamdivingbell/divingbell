{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">HOW TO PLAY</h2>Although there are many other keys to learn, these are the main keys you need to<br>operate the game. Some keys do the exact same thing, such as the bracket keys or<br>page up/page down keys.

The bottom three windows are there to give you different types of information.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SWITCHING BETWEEN UNITS</h2><br>In this game, you will be controlling dozens of different units, so it\u2019s important to<br>know how to switch between them. There is more than one way to accomplish it, and<br>you should learn all of the ways.<br><br><strong>Browse</strong> - If the unit you want to control is visible on the screen, you can press <strong>Return</strong><br>to enter browse mode. At this point, a small box-like cursor will appear on the screen.<br>Use the arrow keys to move this box around until it is positioned on the unit or<br>building you wish to select, then press <strong>Return</strong> again. You can even select enemy units,<br>but you can only look at their status, not control them.<br><br><strong>Cycle Units</strong> - For things like tanks, builders, and frigates. If the unit you want is not<br>currently visible and you don\u2019t feel like driving to the unit, you can press the <strong>Tab</strong><br>key to cycle to the next unit, wherever it may be. The cycle is based on unit number,<br>so sometimes it may seem there is no rhyme or reason as to which unit it goes to<br>next. You can also use the plus and minus keys on the keyboard to move forward and<br>backwards through your units. With practice, this is the fastest way to switch between<br>units.<br><br><strong>Cycle Buildings</strong> - For things like factories, smelters, and radar stations. If the building<br>you want is not currently visible, you may press <strong>Page-up / Page-down</strong> to cycle back<br>and forth between them, very much like the unit cycle. You can also use the bracket<br>keys [ and ] to accomplish the same thing. Solar panels are purposely skipped during<br>the cycle because there are often numerous panels and you can\u2019t actually control<br>them anyway. If you want to select a solar panel you must use the browse feature.<br><br><strong>Hot Keys</strong> - You can use the number row 0-9 at the top of your keyboard to assign spe-<br>cific units or buildings that you need to access more quickly. Press <strong>Shift + Number</strong> to<br>assign a number key to the current unit. You can then use that number key to quickly<br>switch to the assigned unit. This will be especially useful during battles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONTROLLING UNITS</h2>Your first order of business after starting the game should be establishing infrastructure and collecting resources.<br>Without them, you won\u2019t be able to do much.<br>You\u2019ll need all 3 types of resources: Minerals, Gas, and Energy.<br>It may require some hunting around the map to<br>find the minerals and gas, so we\u2019ll talk about<br>those first. You can find these on the map.<br>There are usually deposits of minerals<br>clumped together. Some maps have a<br>lot, and some have very few, so use them<br>wisely. In this screenshot, you can see<br>several rocks and crystals in a formation.<br>Both the rocks and crystals can be used<br>as mineral sources. The formations that<br>look like volcanos are gas vents.
