{"about_the_game":"<strong>Overworld</strong> - Map Keeper\u2019s Realm is world building software that focuses on large scale world creation and procedural generates lower levels that can be fine-tuned hex by hex. With it, you can quickly and easily sculpt your world, retain its history, and share it with others.  Overworld\u2019s propagating levels enables you to create and detail your whole world with a single map. Other features like searchable points of interest and labels breathe life into your world.

There are three main levels: World, Continent, and Region. Landmass created at the world level uses procedural generation to create a hex map at the continent level. The continent level generates the region level. Changes to each level propagate both down and up. POIs propagate across the continent and region level, too!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Interesting...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/be65f2c66fb7cfed37c38869a574d92cb29d629e.jpg"},{"name":"That Won't Do","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/1c348f89fe95555fe786271333df1c66f568a43d.jpg"},{"name":"Apprentice","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/96a9236d97c7afb7fbbdad09c3d99b7e1f1320a9.jpg"},{"name":"Keeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/18319ecb92b4cc5462f1233a98daafd1108db547.jpg"},{"name":"Master Keeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/6835c2e337cca943aa7e5f4b72eaf8e3a2f3a77f.jpg"},{"name":"Art Collector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/4c620820ff42eefdc50ed744345a950f4f7b1d78.jpg"},{"name":"Worldsmith","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/cd777ad69bac2b969732ba54b650ef77abe6d1bc.jpg"},{"name":"Playing God","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/7ec7804ca93ecb65e412e9d6c8ed2419c76392e0.jpg"},{"name":"CEASE AND DESIST","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/78c1fc1d301ac9efdf0cc3df3e83ee25c5d59249.jpg"},{"name":"Give me something I can use!","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1513490/44f8ba77420b96bc3e8b8b48344f191c98dd8d8c.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714625276","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714625276","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714625276","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1513490/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714625276","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<strong>Overworld</strong> - Map Keeper\u2019s Realm is world building software that focuses on large scale world creation and procedural generates lower levels that can be fine-tuned hex by hex.
