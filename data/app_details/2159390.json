{"about_the_game":"<i>&quot;I wan't to live,<br>and not to die.&quot;<br>~ Sumiii</i><br><br>Sumiii is a punishing swimming game, a homage to Jeremy Winterrowd's 2003 game 'The Maze', better and more fondly remembered as the 'Scary Maze Game'. Sumiii is also a remake of my first attempt at developing a game 'Crazy Aems game'. You can't move diagonal, and everything kills you.
