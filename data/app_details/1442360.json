{"about_the_game":"Don't get lost is a procedurally-generated, open-world, open-source, first-person colony sim. Play your own game, or join your friends as you build colonies to harvest natural resources from the infinite world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCraft building materials, or let your townsfolk do it for you, and use an intuitive gridless building system to expand in 3D. Design a logistics system to distribute goods across town, or build a new town where the resources are. Add catapults and guards to defend your colonies as they come under increasingly-difficult tower-defence-style attacks. Manage the needs of your townsfolk, making sure they have enough to eat and don't become unhappy with their lot in life. Level up their skills so that they work faster, and manage their assigned jobs accordingly. Use the materials they make to research new technologies to make your settlements swankier and more efficient. Explore the infinite multi-biome world and interact with it's natural inhabitants (both the hostile and friendly kinds). Go fishing, build a house in the tree tops, farm goats in the mountains, ride on a railway of your own design all whilst playing with, or against, your friends and their townsfolk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut,<br />\r\nMost importantly,<br />\r\nDon't get lost.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442360/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1676753847","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442360/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1676753847","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442360/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1676753847","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1442360/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1676753847","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"LAN PvP","id":47},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Don't get lost is a procedurally-generated, open-world, open-source, first-person colony sim.
