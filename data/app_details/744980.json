In the first phase, the player in control of the ball will decide what they\u2019re going to do. The player has many options depending where they are on the pitch. If they\u2019re near the goal they can shoot or if they\u2019re out wide they can cross, but they can always dribble and pass.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/turn1.gif?t=1680343143\" /><br><br>The following phase, phase two, the other users on the team with possession will take their turn. This will either be to interact with the ball or moving their character to another position on the pitch.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/turn2.gif?t=1680343143\" /><br><br>Phase three now takes place, where the team without possession will all take their turns. They\u2019ll likely be trying to attempt to get to the ball before the team in possession by receiving the ball earlier in the pass. If you\u2019ve dribbled they\u2019ll have the opportunity to tackle you if their players are fast enough to keep up with you! If you\u2019ve taken a shot then the goalkeeper will attempt to save it, but be wary as they don\u2019t always hold onto their shots.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/turn3.gif?t=1680343143\" /><br><br>The final phase is where you see everything played out in front of you on the pitch. This is called the resolve phase as every action is completed and the following phase will be back to the player in possession.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/turn4.gif?t=1680343143\" /><br><br>Following the fourth phase completing it goes back to the first phase and the player in possession takes their turn!<br><br>Our interactive tutorials will offer you some good insights into how to play with different types of actions covered and they\u2019re a good resource to use before getting into a fully fledged game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Character Creation </h2>You can create two different characters in Super Club Soccer. You can either be a player or a manager, but for now we will focus on the player creation.<br><br><br><u><strong>Player Characters </strong></u><br>Every time you create a new player you\u2019ll be given a couple of options. Firstly, you need to decide which position to play. Are you interested in only scoring goals? Do you want to create a tricky winger? Do you prefer to play as the commanding centre back? This is your opportunity to choose. After you pick your position you\u2019re going to need to pick your build. Do you focus more on speed and agility or are you more concerned with having good technique? We provide varied builds for each position based on different playstyles and you can choose one to suit you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/Builds.gif?t=1680343143\" /><br><br>Once you\u2019ve chosen your position and build, you\u2019re going to be asked how you want your player to develop. You\u2019ll have three options here:<br><br><strong>Early Peak</strong> - You will train better when you\u2019re younger and race to your full potential, but your peak potential will be lower than average. This is best used if you want to dominate at a younger age against players of a similar age.<br><br><strong>Mid Peak</strong> - This is the middle of the road player development, you\u2019ll develop at an average pace and hit an average potential. This build allows you to build your player up to a higher peak than the early peak build without having to wait as long as the late peak build<br><br><strong>Late Peak</strong> - As you get older you train better and your overall potential is the highest, the best build if you want a longer career at the top of the game.<br><br>Once your player is created you need to get yourself a contract. Head over to your player profile and you\u2019ll be able to view the available trial contracts. You can request to sign a trial contract for any team with availability but you\u2019ll probably want to include some information for your prospective manager so he\u2019s more inclined to accept it. You\u2019ll also want to start training your player to increase your attributes, but training is increased when you\u2019re under contract at a club so it\u2019s a good idea to get a contract sorted as soon as you can. You can train every day and you choose which attributes you want to focus on, do you improve your physical attributes or your technical attributes? The choice is yours with over 20 different attributes available and they all affect how you perform on the pitch.<br><br><strong><u>Manager Characters</u></strong><br>If you want to head into the world of management then you\u2019re going to want to create a manager character. The process here is a lot less complicated in terms of creating the character but you\u2019re going to need to create a club as well. We have a kit and badge creator in game, so you are really able to give your club a unique identity. You\u2019ll be in charge of signing players, setting the tactics and selecting the team but that\u2019s not all. The financial side of the club will be in your hands too, where you\u2019ll need to look at upgrading your stadium and training facilities when the time is right.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/extras/club1.gif?t=1680343143\" /><br><br>Jump into tournaments with your team to take on other teams from around the globe. Currently we are running a European ladder at 8pm UTC and an Americas ladder at 1am UTC. These tournaments let the club choose what days they\u2019d like to play matches and automatically schedules a match against another club looking to play. Can you climb to the top of the ladder? We\u2019re going to be introducing leagues and cups soon too, so the ladder is good practice for the future.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Test Achievement","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/a910e19241b7fd1cffae80938f9ef4c1d0d70842.jpg"},{"name":"Learning The Ropes","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/71074dd4722b5539e2c531378dd0a0540e3458ae.jpg"},{"name":"First Of Many To Come","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/3c2a3b113a7b124d30165b4a88112f08aabc94ae.jpg"},{"name":"Match Ball","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/82e869821546444dc47859995378dc75a12fa6fe.jpg"},{"name":"Hat-trick","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/e359212587b01cc1e7f81297aa420fe84b129904.jpg"},{"name":"Bend It Like...","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/25d3f3ffaf99ea1a669f24bd58e04af0fde62110.jpg"},{"name":"Wingman","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/b12e4e3c48ee666fcd325c972ba7dda15ba21219.jpg"},{"name":"You Shall Not Pass","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/e616e09992faf02952ae1fef209c88173429a16c.jpg"},{"name":"Multitasker","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/285792b549daf4b6a74ca3301781ee95f5d90f90.jpg"},{"name":"License To Score","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/744980/2dec1e4ce16c9540087f32d794451f6bacae08fa.jpg"}],"total":61},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1680343143","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1680343143","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1680343143","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/744980/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1680343143","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"MMO","id":20},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"In-App Purchases","id":35}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Super Club Soccer is a tactical turn based football game, built from the ashes of Football Identity, where you control a player in a team either online or on your own against our AI.
