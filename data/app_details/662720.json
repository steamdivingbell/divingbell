{"about_the_game":"Battle for victory by casting a variety of spells on your opponents until there's only one mage (or team) standing.  Purchase new spells between rounds using coins you've earned during the fight.  Every game is different, with randomly-generated terrain, randomly-positioned mages and 10 unique spells to choose from (some of which are affected by wind).
