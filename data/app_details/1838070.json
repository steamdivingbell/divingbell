{"about_the_game":"BOK: The Irrational adventure with poorly drawn characters. Ever wondered what it's like to be a chicken that's always at the brink of death? No? Why not? Okay, well then how about we make the art style absolutely terrible and up the difficulty by about 22. Still no? Well, you might be out of luck.<br><br>The <i>very</i> extraordinary adventure includes:<br><br>- 15 unique levels with five different areas to suffer through<br><br>- Alternative difficulty game modes<br><br>- Extra end-game content<br><br>- Cosmetic options with 10 different hats to choose from<br><br>- Crabs???<br><br>- And more to come, I guess.<br><br>Be prepared to be frustrated unless you are an epic gamer, as after countless tests from only an elite selection of gamers (my parents) have tried and failed to complete the game without complaints about difficulty. If you find it too hard, you can try easy mode in the extras menu, and if you find it too easy, there's always hard mode to try. And then limited lives mode. But don't try to do limited lives mode. Seriously.<br><br>BOK is a 2D Indie-Platformer made over the span of about a year by a 13-year-old kid with no experience of coding and learned it along the way. So while that feat. may seem impressive, it may prove to not be after install, mainly proven by the minimalistic and simplistic art style. However, the cartoony feel should make it a more laid-back experience that many can enjoy, as long as you disregard any rage you feel along the way.
