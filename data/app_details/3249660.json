The violence is minimal and presented only in a drawn format. The atmosphere is tense and sometimes unsettling, aligning with the thriller genre. Dialogue occasionally touches on acute social topics, but without propaganda or explicit details. There's also mild suggestive language, though it remains subtle."},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game is already available for download on Windows, Android, Linux, and MacOS.
