{"about_the_game":"&quot;Blow Away Survivors&quot; allows players to actively engage in combat, launching attacks to blow away countless enemies in an exhilarating casual roguelite action experience.<br><br>Players take on the role of bounty hunters navigating stages filled with villains across the galaxy. Each stage consists of four rounds, starting with regular enemies in the first round, followed by powerful bosses and more enemies in the subsequent rounds. Rounds can be completed in as little as 1 to 2 minutes, with a maximum of 5 minutes.<br><br>Hunters level up by gaining experience from defeated enemies, acquiring and enhancing skills. Additionally, weapon customization with dropped items allows players to create their own unique builds, ensuring enjoyable strategic and active combat experiences in short play sessions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic Combat Experience Leveraging Physics Engine</h2>Enemies possess a stability parameter that decreases with each attack. When stability reaches zero, enemies are knocked down, allowing hunters to deliver unique attacks that launch them. Launched enemies can collide with others, akin to bowling pins, enhancing the satisfaction of actively engaging in combat. In addition to skills that trigger in conjunction with attacks, &quot;Blow Away Survivors&quot; offers an overwhelming combat experience characteristic of Vampire Survivors-inspired gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Diverse Hunters with Simple Controls</h2>.Hunter controls are straightforward: use the left stick on the gamepad for movement and three buttons for attacking and evading. There are two attack buttons: rapid pressing triggers consecutive attacks, pressing while moving the left stick triggers strong attacks, and pressing after evading triggers evasion attacks. Each hunter features unique motions and characteristics for these attacks, offering varied combat styles. Skills and weapon customization further enhance individuality, allowing players to build their own unique hunters and enjoy the thrill of active combat.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Plethora of Skills Leveraging Active Play and Physics Engine</h2>.&quot;Blow Away Survivors&quot; boasts over 50 skills triggered by actions such as attacking, evading, and moving, enabling players to choose when to activate them and enhancing the game's active gameplay. Unique skills utilizing the physics engine, such as pulling launched enemies with rubber or absorbing surrounding enemies, further amplify the excitement of each attack.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Live action welcome</h2>.If possible, we would appreciate it if you could post the URL of &quot;Blow Away Survivors&quot; on Steam in an easy-to-understand place.<br>Monetization is not a problem.<br>If it is difficult to do so, please introduce it in your video or distribution.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Press Kit</h2>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Save the Ruins (Normal)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/19ac1390a7abc051a798935527ae3c29d6a060fa.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Ruins (Hard)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/4df3af74bfc8e73f522b8ee171f8352f869076ba.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Ruins (Festival)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/554c80e3c8a0ca90146b4e4d3167f6007502f220.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Colony (Normal)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/2871073ba1d71a3c55e6ea27c9b4a2d326cb04f6.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Colony (Hard)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/208743d209f82e3b0ba98753b1847a08ee1c95a8.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Colony (Festival)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/657ce30db4a85b6831c68d51982db391ff1609e9.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Planet (Normal)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/21f572aa11238211b9f9609eb7f287b222b3de9b.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Planet (Hard)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/0770486b7300b03d7486ceddd893686bda2a4d52.jpg"},{"name":"Save the Planet (Festival)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/b01bc14f92a30a931fc514146f5e679364ada03b.jpg"},{"name":"Defeat the Prison Breaker (Normal)","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2223170/440e64d499fd51a03b489e081bd6709d0c0ad425.jpg"}],"total":18},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722675497","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223170/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722675497","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223170/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722675497","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2223170/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722675497","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;Blow Away Survivors&quot; allows players to actively engage in combat, launching attacks to blow away countless enemies in an exhilarating casual roguelite action experience.<br><br>Players take on the role of bounty hunters navigating stages filled with villains across the galaxy.
