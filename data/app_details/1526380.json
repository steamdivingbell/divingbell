{"about_the_game":"Excavator Simulator VR is a short showcase of what it feels like to operate a giant 90 tonne excavator in either ISO or SAE control patterns. This includes real-time digging, boom/bucket movement, and tank-like movement. Explore levels to climb up hills or dig a mega hole to the ocean. There are no limits even if you prefer not to complete the levels.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1526380/extras/Dig_Example.gif?t=1617116960\" /><br><br>Ever wondered what the difference between heavy machinery controls is or want to improve your excavation skills while in the office?
