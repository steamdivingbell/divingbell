{"about_the_game":"Since people asked for a way to pay for the game, this is essentially your way to make a donation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI didn't want to just make an empty DLC, so I made a half hour long video where I talk about the process of making the game, show some videos of old builds, and look at some of my original concept art and puzzle designs.
