There is a total of 7 major areas, each with many secrets to discover, and various combat encounters to overcome.<br><br>Depending on decisions made, resources used, or curiosity in solving areas in different ways, small variations may present themselves.

As they've spent too much time exposed to the Miasma, most of them are on the verge of death, or mutated beyond saving. However, some are still willing to help until their last breath.<br><br>Potential allies can be recruited into the party, or killed where they stand.

They've taken the likeness of plants and flowers in this region.<br><br>During combat, Anomalis produce varying amounts of Miasma, limiting the amount of turns you have in any given battle. Combined with a diverse arsenal of lethal abilities and overwhelming numbers, defeating them is no easy task. There are over 40 unique encounters, many with multiple phases and subroute variations, all demanding a different strategy from the last.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/summary_b04.png?t=1732775714\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE ARTIFACTS</h2><br>Defeating enemies will sometimes reward Artifacts. Artifacts provide anything from powerful buffs, permanent stat bonuses, new skills, or an active ability.<br><br>The stronger Anomalis specifically reward unique artifacts necessary to conquer the Exclusion Zone. These are complex in both function and in application, providing new combat strategies, skill synergies, and attack strings. Figuring out how to use them in each battle can feel like a puzzle in itself, especially in combination with various turn limits and different enemy groups.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/extras/summary_b05.png?t=1732775714\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ADDITIONAL MODES</h2><br>Thistlemine comes with 3 modes: Standard Mode, Regimental Mode, and the Temporal Rift.<br><br>Standard Mode is the normal gameplay experience. Checkpoints are plenty, dialogue and choices are enabled, there are minimal consequence for losing, and you can progress at your own pace.<br><br>Regimental Mode serves as a time attack variation to Thistlemine's gameplay, encouraging strategies and routes to save both turns and time, with a limit of 2 hours to clear the game. Some adjustments have been made to save as many frames as possible. Though completely optional, it is the canonical Thistlemine experience.<br><br>The Temporal Rift is equivalent to a dev room. It is unlocked by default. Players can use it to experiment with various mechanics and to further optimize their routes. This mode will feature additional challenges and cut content in future updates.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Unarmed and Unharmed","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/5cc5cc336b3f4e7ce9dbbb7b95fcf477a6c27340.jpg"},{"name":"Eldest Daughter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/ef8c443d25cab0b539ff5f30252fb99decbe2a9f.jpg"},{"name":"Conscientious Objector","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/940b2f6ce2d6b1909f400579004e21d67585e014.jpg"},{"name":"Nightmare of Trial and Error","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/2812c5c1a17f9bb9b81c5af910589726c6331e9c.jpg"},{"name":"Hidden Construct","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/928012464c3a1254a51152a3db0ce02d7ed9d83e.jpg"},{"name":"The Cherubine","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/e1c824dc16c738267857d267ef5feebd92aaa670.jpg"},{"name":"The Immortal","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/a6f8e2b6ea1c4362022971aa5d9fca8247922714.jpg"},{"name":"Wall of Roses","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/fa259619f4cde57aef87ce261282618d8495c3db.jpg"},{"name":"Underground Convent","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/d439a6e43e7594b46fbcabda3ae57ab04b17e9db.jpg"},{"name":"Funeral Bouquet","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2090600/b91072b5d30619ead7c09bf60e46015f806ad6b3.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1732775714","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1732775714","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/17359370e877828fc77255629c2e4615bf081c0c/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1732775714","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2090600/17359370e877828fc77255629c2e4615bf081c0c/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1732775714","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","demos":[{"appid":2150280,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THE GAME</h2><br>Thistlemine is a puzzle exploration RPG.
