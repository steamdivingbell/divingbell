{"about_the_game":"This new content pack introduces Jo\u00e3o III as the leader of Portugal.<br><br><strong>Includes the Portugal civilization with Jo\u00e3o III, the Nau unique unit, and two unique structures, the Navigation School building and the Feitoria.</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Civ Unique Ability: Portugal\u2019s unique ability, \u201cCasa Da \u00cdndia,\u201d significantly increases the yields of International Trade Routes, but limits those routes to cities on the coast or with a Harbor. This ability also grants Trader units additional range and the ability to embark on water tiles as soon as they\u2019re unlocked.<br></li><li>Leader Unique Ability: Joao\u2019s unique ability is \u201cPorta Do Cerco,\u201d which grants all units increased Sight. It also increases Trade Route capacity whenever Portugal meets a new civ and provides Open Borders with all city-states.<br></li><li>Unique Unit: Portugal\u2019s unique unit, the Nau, is a naval melee unit that replaces the Caravel.

It also increases a city\u2019s Science yields for every two coastal or lake tiles within the city\u2019s borders and grants additional Great Admiral points.<br></li><li>The Feitoria can only be built by a Nau unit on a foreign city\u2019s coastal tile next to a luxury or bonus resource.

Zombies\u2019 obsession with brain-banquets and digestive-devastation means they can only fall victim to these improvements and never pillage them.<br></li><li>Humanity Takes Control: Two new projects allow civilizations to temporarily subjugate Zombie units within a city\u2019s limits, putting them under player control. The \u201cHoly Site: Turn Undead\u201d project unlocks early, but controls Zombies only briefly. The \u201cCampus: Horde Control\u201d project unlocks later in the game, but grants additional turns with which to command Zombies\u2019 mindless mayhem.
