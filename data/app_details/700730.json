You will have to explore the dark chambers of the dungeon, not knowing what lies beyond the next doorway, and what evil entities and deadly traps await you.  Equipped with your sword and shield, you will collect many objects and magical spells on your journey and it's up to you to use them wisely on your adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDungeoneer is played primarily with the mouse.
