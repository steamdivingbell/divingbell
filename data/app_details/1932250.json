{"about_the_game":"<strong>ABOUT</strong><br><br><i>FURRY TOWER DEFENSE</i> is an esoteric road-trip tower-defense game about hauling a brigade of weaponized furries to the Hull, the place you can reverse an apocalypse. In the accident intended to bring about human immortality, you and your crew cannot be harmed unless the Crystal you carry is destabilized. When the Crystal is down, they target you and your company, seeking to eradicate the last of those who have not turned already. Repairs of the containment device are possible, but take precious manpower and time. You must fight tooth-and-nail in an adventurous campaign, keeping yourselves alive and sane, in order to deliver this Crystal to the Hull.
