Help to rebuild Sigiswal using the upgrade system, which unlocks advantages and new areas in the village. Face your opponents with weapons of your choice, which allow different fighting styles and special attacks. A roguelite action RPG with lots of exploration, fast and tactical hack'n'slay battles and treacherous traps. And mountain devils - they're just everywhere! </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The price of death</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Embark on a dangerous journey where every defeat has its price. Do you hate losing? Then choose your path carefully, because death will take your hard-earned loot! And as if that wasn't enough, the rune curse increases with every fatal exit, which can cost your hero valuable bonuses. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One for all</h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Team up with friends and explore the underground in multiplayer mode for up to 4 players. Good friends share everything, so why not life points? One life bar for all comrades-in-arms, because real friends fight through thick and thin.
