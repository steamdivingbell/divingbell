{"about_the_game":"ICBM is a real-time strategy game of nuclear destruction.

Will you overwhelm your enemy with intercontinental ballistic missiles? Use bombers to deliver massive payloads? Or maybe use submarines to deliver nukes from the least expected locations? These strategies and more can all be used to ensure victory. ICBM has 20 unit types and 12 nuclear weapon types to use, plus 44 technologies to explore.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-adjustthegamespeed.jpg?t=1728381528\" /><br>Take the time to carefully plan your next move, or just nuke your opponents as fast as you can. Increase the contamination speed for a swift and painless nuclear war, or slow it down for an endless nightmare.
