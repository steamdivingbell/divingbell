{"about_the_game":"<strong>Time moves forward only when you do</strong> in the dungeons of WazHack, so you can take your time to solve problems instead of just spamming 'attack' and 'drink healing potion'.<br><br>With over <strong>350 unique items</strong> to be found, you will invent your own solutions to sticky situations. With over <strong>170 different monsters</strong>, many with unusual attacks, you will find plenty of sticky situations!<br><br>The <strong>procedurally-generated dungeon</strong> and vast array of possible items gives immense replay value. Some games you'll find a good weapon early, other times you'll rely on wands or potions or spells.<br><br>You don't see it much in the all-action video above, but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier!<br><br>You start with your choice from <strong>16 character classes</strong>, each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you'll find a great spellbook and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle mage. Or stroll through the dungeon as a Bard, enthralling an every growing audience of blood-thirsty but music-loving kobolds. The choice is yours.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Four Tens","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/c3b361d652bfa2adbdb964da673532538489548e.jpg"},{"name":"All Tens","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/14bd1cae8875a524bffe3779fabf684471f50083.jpg"},{"name":"Ascension","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/4a9145ef81e5f96c44c3f0a960bd0c6ed0557657.jpg"},{"name":"Iron Man","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/8612cdb47b62dea9c1f5e8c6fdf45d3fa1270255.jpg"},{"name":"Blaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/60a54be7dfb7d313213ccedcee81cda91deda03b.jpg"},{"name":"Mega Blaster","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/02d265be96288195b77a67691b1e9e5b3b9a0117.jpg"},{"name":"Birthday Boy","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/de8a5c789ed5079eeba86ba4cf8b7d77012a7fa6.jpg"},{"name":"Birthday Girl","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/e5dc03da7b0137ce67c2d54133a74607672ee136.jpg"},{"name":"Planet Brain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/5d9cba5338a98b79a619a40fa6df05ce3074613e.jpg"},{"name":"Zookeeper","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/264160/1fa1d9041af6b857cede90ea6c69baffaaa12c39.jpg"}],"total":21},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/264160/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1648426887","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/264160/page.bg.jpg?t=1648426887","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/264160/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1648426887","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/264160/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1648426887","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Captions available","id":13},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Remote Play on TV","id":43},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"<strong>Time moves forward only when you do</strong> in the dungeons of WazHack, so you can take your time to solve problems instead of just spamming 'attack' and 'drink healing potion'.<br><br>With over <strong>350 unique items</strong> to be found, you will invent your own solutions to sticky situations.
