{"about_the_game":"A unique deck-building RPG where you gather materials to craft equipment!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25a0 Deck Construction: Skills Acquired and Equipment Skills<br />\r\nYour character's skills aren't just those gained through growth, but also change depending on the weapons and armor equipped. Deck construction involves elements of chance as well as certainty, allowing you to build a deck to your liking!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25a0 Crafting Equipment from Gathered Materials<br />\r\nYou can craft equipment using materials found in dungeons or dropped by monsters. The same piece of equipment may have different grades and skills each time it's crafted, providing endless enjoyment in crafting!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25a0 A Non-Roguelike Deck-Building RPG<br />\r\nIf you fail to conquer a dungeon, your character remains intact. You can either heal and try again with the same character or create a new character to take on the challenge!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25a0 Over 20 Vast Dungeons to Explore<br />\r\nWe plan to feature more than 20 dungeons, with plans to add more. Of course, as the number of dungeons increases, so does the variety of monsters, materials, and equipment types. Take on uniquely challenging dungeons with the strongest equipment!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1725977119","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945790/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1725977119","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725977119","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2945790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725977119","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"A unique deck-building RPG where you gather materials to craft equipment!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u25a0 Deck Construction: Skills Acquired and Equipment Skills<br />\r\nYour character's skills aren't just those gained through growth, but also change depending on the weapons and armor equipped.
