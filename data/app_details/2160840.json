This depiction suggests that the protagonist jumps into a nightmare world, and is not an instruction to commit suicide. The ultimate goal of the game is to avoid a tragic ending. Also, this scene is fleeting and not grotesque. However, those who find it distasteful should be warned."},"detailed_description":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY</strong></h2><br>The setting sun stained the world.<br>It was beautiful, even if I could not escape the darkness that would soon come.<br><br>If you can no longer face the regrets and guilt you can't hold on to, maybe that darkness can help.
