In Normal Mode, players clear stages one by one, interspersed with a curious story of a knight and a princess. The total number of them is 100. The objective is to bring back the princess by making full use of skills that are gradually opened up and passing through enemy characters and tricks. The stages can be redone many times. Use trial and error to find out the nature of the stage, and make sure you get it right. But sometimes you may need some luck.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create your own 10 seconds in the edit mode!</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The game comes standard with an edit mode in the standard package. This allows you to create your own stages using all the gimmicks and effects that appear in the game. You can also upload your stage to the server and receive a code to make it available for others to play.

In addition, in Stage Select, stages that have been cleared at least once can be selected and played again and again.
