{"about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SHOOT 'EM UP!</h2><br>Just keep shooting! Starlight: Eye of The Storm is a retro 2D Arcade bullet hell vertical shooter. Unleash your special powers, upgrade your weapons, get better ones! Danger can come from any direction, including 3D objects in the background.<br><br>The Full Release shall comprise of the following modes you can play:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Campaign Mode - A storytelling modular mission-based play style where you can choose which missions to fly first. Each main mission consists of 3 short segments that must be completed in order to complete the mission as a whole. There'll be 7 main missions and 8 side missions. Side missions offer a slightly different flavour and can yield different types of bounty. Weapon shop can be accessed anytime as well.<br></li><li> Arcade Mode - A no-frills 10-stage play style where the Weapon Shop is accessed once upon a stage's completion. An abridged version of the whole story without the storytelling elements; all action!<br></li><li> Duel PvP Mode - This is a player vs player mode where you and your friends can duke out above Phobos City armed with weapons of your choice. Experiment different builds, different upgrades and see how much it can change the dynamics of the game. <strong>Steam Remote Play recommended!</strong><br></li><li> Survival Mode - All action, no story. Challenge yourself over 40 different waves. Each wave scales up in difficulty over time and you'll still be allowed to upgrade your weapons to counter them!<br></li><li> Boss Rush Mode - All action, but BOSSES ONLY. Unlocked after completing the Campaign mode once (for good reason), you'll have good initial funding to spec your fighter properly before diving into a 12-boss fight without stop. A good mode to challenge yourself against the big guys all at once.
