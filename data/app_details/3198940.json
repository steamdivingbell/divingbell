{"about_the_game":"Challenge a game with a rather surreal worldview in which the player becomes a mosquito and sucks girls blood!<br />\r\nMosquito simulator is a prank game in the type of simulation and survival.<br />\r\nYou controls a mosquito named &quot;Mister Mosquito&quot; who has taken up residency in the house of the girl, life-sized humans that serve as the protagonist's food source in the game. The goal of the game is to stock up on blood through the summer so that the mosquito will survive the winter ahead. You are tasked with sucking blood from specific body parts of the girls without being noticed.<br />\r\nThe challenge in bloodsucking is that each girl has a &quot;stress meter&quot;. You must make sure that the girl stays unaware. Sucking too fast or too slow will increase the girl's stress level. If Mister Mosquito is swatted while sucking blood, instant death occurs. If your are noticed by the girl while flying around, Battle Mode begins, played out like a boss battle. The girl tries to attack Mister Mosquito through various means. To calm her, the player must hit a number of pressure points, relieving them of tension. Once they are relaxed enough, they return to their business.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198940/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1735204676","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198940/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1735204676","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198940/bef5b6f7b1d639f9c5fc247b00b2dcfa8c0b7a0e/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1735204676","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3198940/bef5b6f7b1d639f9c5fc247b00b2dcfa8c0b7a0e/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1735204676","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[1,5],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Challenge a game with a rather surreal worldview in which the player becomes a mosquito and sucks girls blood!<br />\r\nMosquito simulator is a prank game in the type of simulation and survival.<br />\r\nYou controls a mosquito named &quot;Mister Mosquito&quot; who has taken up residency in the house of the girl, life-sized humans that serve as the protagonist's food source in the game.
