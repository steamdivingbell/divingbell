{"about_the_game":"Khemia is a 2D puzzle-platformer with a technological medieval fantasy theme where you play Oti, a little kid who mysteriously has been turned into a goat. The game takes place inside the alchemist's tower, yes, the one who turned our little guy into a goat. You will have to jump, kick, dash and ram the enemies who will block your path!<br><br>While trying to go up the tower you will find difficulties, as the tower is alive and has the mision to hinder your way up. To avoid it, you will have to set up your own map! Slide, rotate or move the different rooms you find inside the cauldron to get to the orbs. Once you obtain an orb, move around the rooms again to get to the door to the next level.<br><br>If an enchanted tower and heavy horns weren't enough, you will have to run for your life while escaping from an evil shadow. Who is that shadow? Will you be able to reach the end with an enemy that will chase you to the end of the world?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/extras/a.png?t=1661971056\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2>A village gripped by fear. A little kid. Alchemy.<br><br>Twenty years have passed since the incident. No one talks about it, but everyone knows. Oti is a little kid who lives ignoring the truth, he just wants to help his friend who got hurt, but his momma told him he can do no good by picking flowers in the forest. However, as a little kid he is, he ignores his mother\u2019s words to get what he wants and suddenly\u2026 he turns into a goat! The curse is upon him!<br><br>To help little Oti get his human body back, you will guide him through the alchemist tower while kicking (literally) the enemies of the room and playing puzzles in a cauldron. This element will help Oti to navigate through different levels the alchemist has prepared, to ensure you escape to the next floor, move around the rooms and get the orb to open the door.<br><br>But beware! A shadow will follow Oti to ensure you both fail!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/extras/e.png?t=1661971056\" /><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/extras/dddd.png?t=1661971056\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAME FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2D Puzzle-platformer with a technological medieval fantasy theme.<br></li><li>The cutest protagonist you have ever seen. <br></li><li>A not-so-evil antagonist and a shadow who creeps around.<br></li><li>Great soundtrack. </li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/extras/i.png?t=1661971056\" />","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1661971056","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/page.bg.jpg?t=1661971056","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1661971056","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2081800/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1661971056","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2085780,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"Khemia is a 2D puzzle-platformer with a technological medieval fantasy theme where you play Oti, a little kid who mysteriously has been turned into a goat.
