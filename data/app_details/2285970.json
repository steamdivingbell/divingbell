{"about_the_game":"In the Trailmakers: Airborne Expansion you will take to the skies in an epic campaign to save the peaceful Chirpos from the pesky Robot Pirate invasion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Campaign</h2>In this mission-based campaign you will navigate a brand new Trailmakers-world with deserts, mountains, and beautiful floating islands. The local Chirpo population will grant you increasingly challenging quests as you progress deeper into the dangerous Robot Pirate territory.<br><br>As you complete their quests you will receive blocks, parts, engines, wings, thrusters and so much more \u2014 giving you all the tools you need to soar the skies majestically like an eagle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Friendly- and enemy NPCs</h2>The Chirpos are friendly, fuzzy and flightless birds. They hold up in villages scattered across the land \u2014 the lucky ones anyway. The less fortunates ones are held in Robot Pirate captivity and the Chirpo Mayor of each village will kindly ask that you bring them home safely.<br><br>The Robot Pirates are evil, ruthless and quite agile dog fighters. They will defend their newly invaded territory with fighter planes, flak cannons, blimps, hot air balloons and ground speeders. They are a \u201cshoot first, ask later\u201d kind of people so we advise you to implement the same strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sandbox map</h2>The new map is a big one \u2014 and it\u2019s open for you to explore as you please. You choose your own path but beware: Some areas are more dangerous than others and it\u2019s wise to make sure you are geared up properly before heading into certain areas.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cleared for take-off</h2>Without revealing too much we would rather let you see it for yourself.
