{"about_the_game":"Ascend the crumbling ruins of a fallen kingdom by jumping, swinging, shooting, and teleporting your way through enemies and obstacles. New knowledge and abilities will aid you on your increasingly challenging skyward journey. It's like a reverse Downwell or a reverse-inverted finite Doodle Jump.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA single game is quick and simple: reach the sun with as much silver as possible. Silver represents both currency and score so purchasing useful power-ups must be balanced with the long term goal of a respectable grade. Death will start you back at the beginning with nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe controls in Thy Kingdom Crumble are a little different than your usual platformer. Left clicking will have you jump towards the cursor and a right click activates any equipped abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe haunting soundtrack was composed by Gisula.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Out of the House","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/6a3b717aeeaf85deb17ee06ddac509cda596d2f8.jpg"},{"name":"Into the Sky","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/324b86445d9045bcfe5c10d3a92e8ff262350fd6.jpg"},{"name":"Then Space","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/69b61eca132755e46ff9ebcdf3b01424295134c4.jpg"},{"name":"To the Kingdom","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/15d0d2ca4e834b62866820cb5617de1319b349ca.jpg"},{"name":"Winner","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/0a30bb5e3d8ecba336d451f7e6725b0791d98896.jpg"},{"name":"A Productive Week","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/63505b85e16f9bfb9ef06d190081b672d0340b40.jpg"},{"name":"Winner +1","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/0e795967fa032ee91c64b1331971fbfeaa2d5a72.jpg"},{"name":"No Handicap","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/e0580ad293e222525806546e5aa2f0d48ccc668f.jpg"},{"name":"Impoverished","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/fc5cdbe585f707f185882776427a385e6e06cf13.jpg"},{"name":"\"Friend\"","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1148290/5a11b669d9d0462a0ab900cd4dca79546a84c23d.jpg"}],"total":11},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148290/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1588450409","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148290/page.bg.jpg?t=1588450409","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148290/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1588450409","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1148290/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1588450409","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Leaderboards","id":25},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Ascend the crumbling ruins of a fallen kingdom by jumping, swinging, shooting, and teleporting your way through enemies and obstacles.
