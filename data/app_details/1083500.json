Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.<br></li><li>\t<strong>MASSIVE WARFARE:</strong> Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.  <br></li><li>\t<strong>ENORMOUS MAPS:</strong> PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable.

You are the beating heart of any squad. <br><br><strong>Infiltrator:</strong> Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. <br><br><strong>Engineer: </strong> Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. <br><br><strong>MAX:</strong> Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\t<strong>OUTFIT TEAMWORK:</strong> Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out.
