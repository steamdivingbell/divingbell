Based on the block types, the triomino blocks may cancel out or replace the blocks below them, and after block cancellation, the remaining block(s) may further fall down.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1579270/extras/Triadino_Placement.gif?t=1703049476\" /><br><br>Triadino has three game modes: Casual, Regular and Challenging, plus two leveling up modes: Line Clearing and Full Clearing. These modes determine the falling speed of the triominos and the speed increment when the game levels up.
