I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many mice and cheese as they can inside it. Now it\u2019s your job to find them all! With 15 art pieces to choose from, and 1500+ hidden objects you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a hidden object, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty:</h2>All levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music to help you connect with the world, as you search for everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of hidden objects back into a painting so you can find them again! It\u2019s much harder when there are only a few hidden objects left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you\u2019d like to start over.<br><br>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/e27435dcf5d248beee6ef909850b25c17ab86475.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Lighthouse Islands","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/bfb5d951517caa4037988b88627e7b96e85352a3.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Book Store Monsters","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/cd522399f3066a2c242691bcc327fc1f188fdf2e.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Messy Pet Store","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/652bdf5a133127ba2ed9270aec70cdf8662e6fe1.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Horse Riding Friends","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/16bef43d016b670474a7c11db7cac01f444244aa.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Gaming Party Couch","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/d6d63c403e02e04b7a36850ab44c89c00c34a8fb.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Spilling Kitchen","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/0b00f28f378893393a55431b86933c720ada9d2b.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Kitty Cake Shop","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/d2ec3f527b3eaa1f165ee2754832ae9b151a39fd.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Radio Picnic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/e7363ebac2bed4d449668910033f2caf04e28eb4.jpg"},{"name":"Complete the Floral Gramophone","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/2824860/cd12afaf00dae3ddc170bedb4398bbbd74dd6352.jpg"}],"total":16},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2824860/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1722349649","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2824860/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1722349649","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2824860/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1722349649","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2824860/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1722349649","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<h1>Recommended for you</h1><p><br></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2>\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f 15 Unique artworks<br>\u2753 1500+ Hidden objects total<br>\ud83d\udc01 750+ Mice<br>\ud83e\uddc0 750+ Cheese.<br>\ud83d\udca1 \u221e Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>\u267b\ufe0f Restore a small number of hidden objects to a painting so you can find them again!<br>\ud83c\udfb5 Music for each artwork<br>\u2328\ufe0f Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br>\ud83d\udcbe 3x save slots<br>\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Reset progress entirely and play again<br>\ud83d\udd52 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Context:</h2>The brief was simple.
