{"about_the_game":"* Special screening for Ars Electronica Festival 2020.

The player becomes a deceased political prisoner's ghost in his journey to find his way home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the era has long gone, the emerging digital technologies follows suit. Governments started to use new technologies like digital surveillance, big data and AI as means to monitor and control people. Powerful world leader uses tweets less than 140 characters to set the course for his country. Human beings are reduced to a few pixels on the screen and left to the military drone pilot to decide for their lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Bodyless, the retrospective martial law governing and ultramodern digital technologies are fused into a dark oppression against folk\u2019s living and beliefs. The audience experiences the journey through the eyes of an old man who was a political criminal under a government\u2019s secret experiment. After his death, he became a ghost and descended to the underworld. In Taiwanese folk belief, during \u201cGhost Month\u201d, the hell gate will open for ghosts to visit their families. The old man\u2019s ghost makes up his face and ascends to earth. Through his eyes, the folk culture forms a rich spiritual world interwoven with nature. However, a mechanical force starts to deteriorate the spiritual world and eventually reduces human forms and memory into simple geometrical shapes that can be easily processed by the technologies.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1202100?t=1603143585","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202100/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1603143585","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202100/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1603143585","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1202100/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1603143585","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Only","id":54},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"* Special screening for Ars Electronica Festival 2020.
