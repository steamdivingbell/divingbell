{"about_the_game":"In &quot;<strong>The Chalk</strong>,&quot; you'll descend into the depths of a treacherous and twisted mine that's said to be cursed by an otherworldly force. Inspired by a true story from the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1800s, &quot;The Chalk&quot; pits you and other players against each other in a battle for survival and wealth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FIND YOUR WAY OUT</strong></h2>As you progress further trough the mine's four floors, you'll need to mark your path with chalk to track where you've been and need to go. With no map to guide you, you'll need to rely on your wits, instincts, and perhaps a bit of luck to make it out alive.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2135600/extras/The_Chalk_Drawing_Gif.gif?t=1680091296\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BE AWARE OF THE MONSTER</strong></h2>But you're not alone down there.
