{"about_the_game":"Vox-L is not a game.  It's a customizable virtual reality playground.<br><br>By default, Vox-L is just an infinite white terrain.  There's nothing there.  You can't do anything fun.  Sounds boring, I know...<br><br>But here are some reasons we think you'll enjoy it.<br><br><br>Reason 1: <br><br>It has free multiplayer.  You can invite your friends.  (If you have troubles starting a multiplayer game, we have a forum topic where we are discussing the multiplayer feature.  See the Basic Info section for a link to our forum.)<br><br><br>Reason 2: <br><br>It is customizable.  With free in-game apps, you can transform your playground into whatever you want.  Apps let you change the terrain, spawn toys, load dynamic content, launch mini-games, etc.<br><br><br>Reason 3: <br><br>We've already added several apps for you to customize your experience.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Builder app: Gives you tools to deform the voxel terrain by placing/removing blocks (like in Minecraft).

If it doesn't work for you, please post on our support forum.)<br></li><li> Worlds app: Choose from various pre-built worlds.  We currently have 3 voxel worlds.  We'll be adding over 100 more in early 2017.<br></li><li> Flashlight app: Turn your tablet into a flashlight.  Control the color and brightness.  It's surprisingly fun.<br></li><li> Sky app: Change the time of day, add fog, add clouds.  </li></ul><br><br>Reason 4: <br><br>We are adding new apps constantly.
