Feel free to watch the video below; we sent him a comment and hopefully we can work out his prize soon!<br><br></p><br><h1>06/08/2024</h1><p>We were hoping to set up a pre-record of the speed run of the winner but it seems it may be too advanced for our small team at the moment so instead, here is the speedrun. This winner was the sole participate of the event but hey, even so, they got a cash prize:  <br><br>Let Them Breathe: Selena's Awakening is our next project scheduled for September 2nd, 2024. We hope to have the game play trailer out on the 17th so you all can add it to your wish list.</p><br><h1>Buzz</h1><p>We have a WINNER for the Speed Run Event. The winner will be announced the same day we announced the title of the upcoming game currently in production. So expect later this month!</p><br><h1>03/02/2024, 09:07 PM CDT</h1><p>This game does not have a tutorial. To play the game, one must think of the general mechanics of a PC game. For instance, if the mouse clicker is hidden on your screen when starting the game then click the 'windows' icon on your computer so as the mouse can appear.</p><br><h1>03/8/2024, 11:44 AM CDT</h1><p>We're quite please to see the good reviews for Hello Mother. And yes, we also saw the discussion on the page; for a game to be submitted on , a player needs to request it. Now we could request it ourselves but that would mean we would also have to participate within the run's contest.</p><br><h1>04/23/2024, 5:43pm CDT</h1><p>It has come to our attention one can not submit the game to Speed Run unless they are a well known user. As a result of this finding, if submitting to the speed run event:<br><br>1.) Upload to Youtube<br>2.) Email or comment the Youtube Link to us</p><br><h1>03/17/2024, 12:52 PM CDT</h1><p>So glad so many are enjoying the game! Also there will be no more updates for this game. We are in the mist of working on our next game. Still, good luck to all those who enter into the contest!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2787890/extras/LTB_Hello_Mother_Trailer.gif?t=1719015844\" /><br><br>Mrs. Chen, the mother of Jesse Chen, is asked to pick up some documents; these documents reside at the University of Tokyo where she used to work.
