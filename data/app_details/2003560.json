{"about_the_game":"The indie game, Pacfish is a thrilling, Fast-paced, maze-chase style undersea adventure in which a tropical fish has to interact with other dangerous characters with strategies, while eating all dots scattered around every unique maze. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game, every level contains an unique maze. Your primary goal is to find the best way to eat all dots. Due to some sea creatures either wander around their territories or hold their grounds, you will have a great challenge to survive. 1. Try to use terrain or skills to avoid puffer fish. 2. When sharks swim through the coral maze to hunt, it is best to hide and stay still. 3. Beware of the attack of the fighting fish. Every few seconds, a dot becomes a power dot. After eating the power dot, you can fight back against enemies and gain one skill.
