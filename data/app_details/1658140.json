{"about_the_game":"HRO: Adventures of a Humanoid Resources Officer is a puzzle-driven visual novel set in a retro-futuristic sci-fi universe. You play the underappreciated Humanoid Resources Officer aboard the <i>Endeavor</i> \u2014 a military spaceship with more than its fair share of crew rivalries, office politics, and erratic decision-makers. When the <i>Endeavor</i> stumbles into universe-shaking trouble, can you harness the power of the bureaucracy to rein in your crew\u2019s worst impulses and survive to the next episode? <br><br>As disaster looms, you -- the HRO -- interact with key characters to investigate the crisis, identify possible responses and implement your preferred paper-pusher solution. Will your conversation with the criminally-insane physicist who has seized control of the ship inspire you to fake your own resignation so you can infiltrate his cult? Or, when surrounded by bloodthirsty Kirmulak warships, will you choose to transmit the stolen enemy command codes to disable their vessels and allow the <i>Endeavor</i> to escape? Save the day!
