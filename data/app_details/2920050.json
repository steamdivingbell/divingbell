The system meticulously records head and hand motion data to analyze both active and sustained attention, as well as hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. The vCAT\u2122 provides detailed, objective metrics on focus, self-control, and physical steadiness, and furnishes comparative analyses against normative benchmarks for corresponding age and gender categories.
