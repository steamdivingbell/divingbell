Great care has been taken to emulate the feel and look of proto-FPS of the early '90s, while adding modern mechanics such as a dash and a combo system.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Play for fun or compete in the leaderboard</strong></h2>With many achievements and five difficulty levels for players of all skills, <i>The Tome of All Tales</i> can be enjoyed as a fun daily mini-game, something like <i>Wordle</i> but with guns.
