{"about_the_game":"<strong>Deadfall</strong> is a dark, bloody, atmospheric, dynamic, brutal shooter in the spirit of action movies of the 80s and 90s.<br><br><strong>Story:</strong><br>2026 year. In the depths of Rockford Island, a group of scientists led by Ben Broadbury is conducting experiments on primates. Their goal is to create a drug that enhances the physical abilities of a person. You are Roach Craig, a sergeant and the best fighter of the valiant B4 unit under the command of Colonel Paul Greenberg, a military enthusiast with a wealth of combat experience. After receiving intelligence about the experiments, he sent his agent Alex Byrne to the laboratory to get the drug and strengthen his soldiers. The agent arrived at the scene and soon stopped communicating. To find out what happened, the Colonel sends his best B4 squad to the island, led by Roach. But getting there is not so easy - the whole island is guarded by the best people of Broadbury!<br><br>The game will definitely appeal to all fans of bloody dynamic shooters, fans of old school games and the atmosphere of action films of the 80s and 90s, which permeates the entire game. The development of the game was primarily inspired by the 2004 game Far Cry from the Crytek studio and such films as Terminator, Rambo, Commando, Predator and others. The game also contains a lot of humor and references. The soundtrack is written in the Metal genre with notes of Industrial, Synthwave and also has a clear spirit of the Terminator.<br><br><strong>Features</strong>:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fight on dangerous tropical islands infested with creatures and mercenaries<br></li><li>Explore laboratories, bunkers and other complexes with their own dangers<br></li><li>Large-scale levels with variety of passages<br></li><li>There are 2 difficulty modes to choose from: \u201cRecruit\u201d and \u201cVeteran\u201d<br></li><li>Various vehicles are at your disposal: military humvees and boats with a machine gun and a rocket launcher on board, and even tanks<br></li><li>Complete various dangerous missions on the way to your goal<br></li><li>B4 Squad Command System: Work with teammates or alone<br></li><li>Over 15 types of firearms, grenades and first aid kits available<br></li><li>Use different tactics to fight enemies: attack head-on or stealth<br></li><li>Beautiful realistic visual and sound effects<br></li><li>Dynamic explosive soundtrack in the genres of Metal and Synthwave performed by the author<br></li><li>A touch of black humor and fervor</li></ul>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2448420?t=1729162961","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2448420?t=1729162961","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2448420/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1729162961","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2448420/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1729162961","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"demos":[{"appid":2566110,"description":""}],"detailed_description":"<strong>Deadfall</strong> is a dark, bloody, atmospheric, dynamic, brutal shooter in the spirit of action movies of the 80s and 90s.<br><br><strong>Story:</strong><br>2026 year.
