{"about_the_game":"Other Submarine is an indie game rooted in the scary genre, you are an engineer trapped at the bottom of the ocean when your only crew mate has fallen victim to a terrible fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have to be able to re-engineer the fueling system and keep your head above water to escape. There are other crew members- erm well, stowaways, that you might not want to ignore. They have a fancy way of keeping their victims right where they want them.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Survivalist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1025890/cd5fe6f5a9c3b94d1990ec09c28eb57fcb0b11d9.jpg"},{"name":"Completionist","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1025890/afd0b39c417f876e94b6b9e7591e75700e4a8527.jpg"},{"name":"Engineer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1025890/a2d5dd90748bff5cd9ec4a09402c1a24c501817c.jpg"},{"name":"Had a Bad Day","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1025890/07c3633839d0253c8c86c1c27988302f9ac58fa3.jpg"},{"name":"Tour Guide","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1025890/9001c47c99172a2d2432d5f3d41f0f2f497e509a.jpg"}],"total":5},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025890/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1714955952","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025890/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1714955952","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025890/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1714955952","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1025890/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1714955952","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"Slight violence\r\nImplied Violence\r\nSome Gore"},"detailed_description":"Other Submarine is an indie game rooted in the scary genre, you are an engineer trapped at the bottom of the ocean when your only crew mate has fallen victim to a terrible fate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have to be able to re-engineer the fueling system and keep your head above water to escape.
