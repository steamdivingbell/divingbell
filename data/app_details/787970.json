{"about_the_game":"The archangels of Heaven are planning their first miracle on Earth in over four hundred years. In order to succeed, they need your help!

Join them in <i>miraclr: Divine Dating Sim</i>.<br><br><i>miraclr</i> is a comedic workplace romance visual novel starring the biblical (and apocryphal) archangels\u2014plus Lucifer!--told in an office collaboration app. The story takes place in real-time over one week as you help the angels decide upon, then execute, a divine miracle.
