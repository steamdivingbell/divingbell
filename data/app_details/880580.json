Your goal is to survive as long as possible and endure as many enemy waves as you can.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play YORG.io</h2>The game is divided into day and night. During the day you will be safe, so use this time wisely to prepare and fortify your base.<br>Start by building your base and placing crystal mines which are your main source of income. If your mines are not connected to your base, place a transporter. To defend your base and survive the night, you will need defensive towers; since those require ammunition, you will have to build factories to produce them; these factories require resources, you will have to build mines to extract them. Did we mention the importance of supply lines?<br>At night, zombies will spawn and attack your buildings. Every day the zombies steadily get stronger, and every 10 waves a zombie boss will spawn. The game is lost when your Base is destroyed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Highly Replayable</h2>Each game starts with a new configuration of available resources. This configuration must be carefully considered when placing your base and will change your strategy from game to game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique towers</h2>Each tower has strengths and weaknesses. Place them carefully to make sure you are using them to their full potential and always make sure they have plenty of ammo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemy Abilities</h2>As the day turn into night the waves of Zombies become harder. Zombies will evolve various abilities that will challenge even the most titanic defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Big Boss</h2>The Dread Overlord shows up every 10 waves. This boss will require all your might to defeat it. Do not underestimate it!  <br><br>There is no limit to the game, so the longer you stay alive the higher your name goes in the leaderboard. Now go ahead and show your friends who is the ultimate defender!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880580/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1728489219","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880580/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1728489219","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880580/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728489219","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880580/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728489219","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/880580/extras/giphy_1.gif?t=1728489219\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About YORG.io</h2>YORG.io is a fun game about supply chains and zombies.
