{"about_the_game":"Can you solve the Puzzle of the Gems to set the cursed pirate free and claim his treasure? <strong>GEM JAM</strong> features challenging &quot;match three&quot; puzzle play with a twist: you choose where the groups of gems are placed. Oh, and did we mention that the chest is shrinking so you will need to hurry. If that sounds overly challenging, we let you choose from five distinct game styles ranging from the addictive but challenging fun of Big Booty down to the peaceful pressure-free Pirate's Zen mode. If you think that match three games were all the same, it is time to think again! Try solving the Puzzle of the Gems and see what match three was meant to be!","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194200/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1601939309","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194200/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1601939309","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194200/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1601939309","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1194200/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1601939309","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Tracked Controller Support","id":52},{"description":"VR Supported","id":53}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Can you solve the Puzzle of the Gems to set the cursed pirate free and claim his treasure? <strong>GEM JAM</strong> features challenging &quot;match three&quot; puzzle play with a twist: you choose where the groups of gems are placed.
