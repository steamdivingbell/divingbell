The puzzles within its walls will challenge your logical deduction, observation skills, perseverance, and real-world knowledge of everyday facts. With a day-and-night cycle, you must balance exploration during both periods: Days of tranquil monotony, and nights of dread and danger, requiring you to use anything you can find to defend yourself from ghastly threats. Discover the secrets that the Manor hides if you wish to survive longer than the 72 hours you have left before you die.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>PUZZLES</strong></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3266910/extras/Puzzle_Gif__Steam_Page_.gif?t=1729816957\" /> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Using physics as a base, Sepulchron's puzzles go beyond simply finding an item to act as a 'key' to solve them, as many puzzle games do.
