{"about_the_game":"Voldemort? Gandalf? Wimps.<br> <br>Do you have what it takes to be a wizard? In SpellShokked, you assemble magical symbols into devastating spells that you then hurl at your opponents \u2013 other wizards, monsters, or your friends. Fair Warning, Apprentice: this is <strong>NOT</strong> a twitch game. Combat in SpellShokked is agonizingly slow. Being successful requires nerves of steel more than anything else. Yes, that onrushing fireball sure is disconcerting. Keep calm, finish your spell. Don't hasten casting, or you will die. SpellShokked! is all about keeping your nerve, rather than having quick reflexes. Want to win? Take note of the spell your opponent is assembling. Think twice about which spell to start yourself. When done casting, aim carefully. Never, ever, blink with a spell half-cast. Always look over your shoulder, always check the ground you stand on. Being paranoid is a definite plus here.
