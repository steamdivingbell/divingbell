{"about_the_game":"Few know Ashley Harding is the daughter of Benny the Diamond, the East End's most feared underworld boss. But rather than embrace a life of lawlessness and wealth, Harding chose to follow her dream of becoming an officer in the British Army. After years earning the grudging respect of her male peers, Harding finally made captain - just as the Horzine nightmare erupted to destroy her ambitions, drowning Harding's elite military unit in blood and madness. Now Ash is a one-woman army driven by the need to push back the darkness and tear evil a new one.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210931/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1447355682","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210931/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1447355682","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210931/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1447355682","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/210931/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1447355682","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Few know Ashley Harding is the daughter of Benny the Diamond, the East End's most feared underworld boss.
