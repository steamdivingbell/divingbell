{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a valley forgotten by time, surrounded by towering mountains and dense forests, lies a region marked by a dark history. In the heart of this territory, an ancient village prospered for centuries thanks to a pact with Eternis, a supernatural entity that demanded animal sacrifices in exchange for abundance and protection. The cult that served Eternis performed its rituals in different locations in the region, spreading its influence in every corner of that valley. When the villagers rebelled, destroying the cult and burying the central altar, they angered Eternis, who placed a curse on the entire valley. The entity corrupted the village and surrounding areas, bringing to life monstrous figures that symbolize the betrayal of the pact and transforming the environments into macabre reflections of their wrath.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Decades later, a group of strangers arrive at the place for different reasons.
