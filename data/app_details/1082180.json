{"about_the_game":"Without a shadow of a doubt it is one of the most dangerous motorbike races in the world. In TT Isle of Man \u2013 Ride On the Edge 2, you prove your worth in different championships before setting out to conquer the Snaefell Mountain Course, a 60 km-long track with both winding and straight sections that will push your riding skills to the limit. TT 2 features 17 additional tracks, 18 different motorbikes including classic models, and the official riders. And now it\u2019s more realistic than ever, thanks to entirely revamped physics and faithfully reproduced rider movements. Fine-tune your motorbike, upgrade its performance and monitor its data in real time so you can stay competitive. TT2 also offers a brand-new open world, a biker's paradise where you can test your bike settings and gain the experience you'll need to win the TT Isle of Man title!","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Let's pretend it never happened","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/6db00b6c0cad3bc685f463fa22ccfac4fbcd5fc2.jpg"},{"name":"No pain no gain","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/0c4eaa100b04158dc164cccc283f5046bc662514.jpg"},{"name":"Humble beginnings","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/b377e5851f86c052f8d192b8b902a835938a4b5c.jpg"},{"name":"Day/night cycle","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/d1f242f28a1409df49b4306245a89ea028e600b3.jpg"},{"name":"Ready for take-off","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/e3f4e57e6cd6dcb5e8e4b2aeed756199c160837e.jpg"},{"name":"Rising star","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/27f09e6915da57d69573a9952504a34991af74b5.jpg"},{"name":"Road trip","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/01248554064f667475daba8612c31bcf3008abd8.jpg"},{"name":"Shiny and Chrome","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/96c14a1d29db6622fa2aaab787579412337382a2.jpg"},{"name":"Pimp my ride","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/696d6a78bfe3d4dfa9ceb8af96f9f14e9ad8da93.jpg"},{"name":"Bulk up","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1082180/3fa960208f396639f7429ccd08078a2208427176.jpg"}],"total":35},"background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1082180?t=1725352899","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082180/page_bg_raw.jpg?t=1725352899","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082180/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1725352899","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1082180/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1725352899","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Without a shadow of a doubt it is one of the most dangerous motorbike races in the world.
