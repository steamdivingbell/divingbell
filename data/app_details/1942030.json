{"about_the_game":"Nero Score\u00a0 - The real-world PC benchmark<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNero Score is a free tool which measures your processor\u2019s (CPU) multi-core power and is pushing your graphics card (GPU) to it\u2019s maximum limit with real world multimedia use cases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNero Score is used by journalists to review hardware, hardware manufacturers to optimize their latest products, as well as computer owners to evaluate their individual system to make purchase decisions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWHAT KIND OF BENCHMARKS ARE INCLUDED IN NERO SCORE?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Now Nero Score includes Metaverse benchmark with 3D real-time rendering test on GPU.*<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNero Score includes AI Tagging test and AVC Decoding and Encoding tests.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAI Tagging test will generate a CPU AI benchmark and measures how many pictures per second can be processed with artificial intelligence on the given CPU. So this is not about training an model, but actually applying a trained model on data (called inference). The outcome of this test will let you compare how different CPUs score in this domain. The result can be 1:1 matched with CPU-based AI inference solution, like e.g. Nero AI Photo Tagger. The data set for this test includes 50 pictures that will be inferred 3 times each. The format and size of the pictures doesn\u2019t matter for this test as the AI inference only needs an input of 299\u00d7299 pixels in size anyway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAVC Decoding and Encoding test will generate a CPU AVC benchmark and a GPU AVC benchmark. AVC test measures how many frames per second can be processed with system AVC decoding and encoding on the given CPU and GPU. The result can be 1:1 matched with system AVC solution, like e.g. Nero MKV Converter, Windows Movies &amp; TV, etc. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHOW IS THE SCORE CALCULATED?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNero is fully transparency on the calculation of the actual score. Each of the tests executed within Nero Score will generate a score of it\u2019s own. For example: The CPU AI benchmark measures how many pictures are processed per second. This number is multiplied by a factor of 25 to generate the score for this specific test. So there is a 1:1 relation between the score and the performance of the CPU for the given task. A PC with twice the score will be twice as fast.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs soon as there are more tests a total score will be calculated from the single results and the simple formula for this calculation will be made transparent, too. Over time there might be changes on how the score is calculated, those will be called out and documented with revisions to ensure that results are always reproducible and comparable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHOW CAN I CHECK MORE REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE DATA?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nscore.nero.com will list all performance data which submitted by customers.
