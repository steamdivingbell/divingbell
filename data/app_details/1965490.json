{"about_the_game":"This is a game about aimless wandering. After saving the world in the first few minutes, the player is invited to embark on a pilgrimage to meet &quot;The Great Monkey&quot;. The ending point of the pilgrimage, meeting &quot;The Great Monkey&quot;, can be accomplished in different ways. There are many hours of riddles to solve, handcrafted top-down &quot;zelda-like&quot; landscapes to to explore, fulgurite shards to collect and a ton of atmosphere to soak-in. The gameplay is grounded in familiar game mechanics but it comes together to create a non-goal-oriented, stress-free and focused experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMist Monkey: wanderer is designed to highlight the feeling of having the freedom to wander, get lost and discover. With gameplay that won't leave you feeling addicted and overplayed, you'll probably feel better after playing than you did before. There won't be much adrenaline fueled gameplay and you may experience a calming of your heart-rate. There will be &quot;zen-like&quot; moments as you dash, dance and hop past storm spirits. You can spend time meditating (yes there is a button for that) to calming music as you ponder the answers to koan-like riddles. You may just enjoy wandering the ten different biomes, each with their own unique music, obstacles, riddles and fulgurite shards to collect.
