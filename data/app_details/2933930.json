Each class offers intuitive gameplay, and there is a good synergistic level amongst the cards. The game difficulty is relatively low, allowing nearly every player to achieve a playthrough and enjoy that thrilling rush of strategic victory!  <br> <br>However, limited by budget and resources, the game still has many areas needing refinement. Every indie developer, including us, strives to offer both innovative and well-polished games. We truly appreciate the support from every player who has joined us on this journey!
