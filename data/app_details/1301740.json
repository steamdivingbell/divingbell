Hope for finding the missing population has started to dwindle, as you and your friends continue to do your best to stay away from the invading machines and scour abandoned buildings for weapons and equipment. However, recent scouting missions that you have conducted on your own and with friends have yielded some unexpected results - structures that appear to be made by the FNIX machines have started appearing along the Southern Coast of mainland \u00d6stert\u00f6rn. Thankfully it seems that there are also survivors, scattered across both the Southern Coast, the Archipelago and Farmland regions, putting up resistance against the invaders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPANSION PACK FEATURES</h2><strong>ALTERED LANDSCAPES</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301740/extras/fnixrising_altered_landscapes.gif?t=1691507593\" /><br>As your path leads you back to this previously explored area of \u00d6stert\u00f6rn, you discover that the machines have been busy repurposing the landscape to fit their needs. Massive walls that make up fortifications, ominously glowing generators and the looming cable network are but a few of the structures you have sighted while sneaking through the area. Nearby towns are left in ruins as Harvesters gather up any resource that can be of use, leaving only the shells of buildings that once stood there. It\u2019s unclear what FNIX is planning, but whatever it is can\u2019t be good. <br><br><strong>THE RESISTANCE GROWS</strong><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1301740/extras/fnixrising_resistance_grows_2.gif?t=1691507593\" /><br>Your return to the Archipelago and Farmlands regions has also offered you a glimmer of hope, as you bump into clear signs of human resistance. Where once you associated this region mostly for the clear signs of the struggle between the military and the machines in the early days of the invasion, with towns left in ruins and destruction and death everywhere you looked, you are now finding individuals who have managed to survive despite the odds. Pockets of survivors have managed to bunker down in key locations, utilizing strategic positions to stay safe and maximize damage towards the hostile machines.
