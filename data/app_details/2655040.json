{"about_the_game":"You will start your journey from the city of &quot;Tektinburg&quot;. This is an old mining town that was famous for mining minerals. Most of all, Tektite was mined there, they say it has some kind of paranormal properties, but these were just rumors to attract customers up to a certain time. Recently, miners have been actively disappearing there, and subsequently some strange creatures similar to humans began to climb out of it. They were determined to aggressively destroy everything around and it was decided to cordon off the place. Now this city is surrounded by mercenaries, explored and just those who are hungry for profit. In this mine, things began to appear that had not been issued before, which is why they attracted a lot of collectors. The cost of such outlandish things with various effects can go beyond all mental chapels. <br>Because of the abundance of rumors and good rewards, you, as an adventurer, came to this town to get rich. These mines are very dangerous and impassable for most people. How far can you go? Or maybe you can find out why these scary monsters appeared in the local mines in the first place? Their appearance is not natural and is very mysterious. Maybe all of this ....<br><br>This game is a 3-person RPG with a race system. You will start the game from a city where you can buy weapons, armor, potions and other things that can help you run. You will have the opportunity to take tasks from the city, upon completion of which you will be given a reward in the form of items / gold / reputation. Having prepared for the race, you will go to the dungeon in which you will encounter enemies / obstacles that need to be overcome. After completing all the cards, you will go to a &quot;New circle&quot; in which the difficulty of the opponents will increase, and the things you get will be more rare. The main goal of the game is how far you can go into the dungeon. Side goals can be different, raising the reputation in the city / completing all tasks in the guild of the city / getting all the things in the game, etc.<br><br>The game is currently under development. New characters, mechanics, items, etc. will be added over time. The game was not finalized, for the purpose of feedback from users who will not be indifferent to this project.
