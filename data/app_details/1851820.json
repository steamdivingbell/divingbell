{"about_the_game":"<i> </i> <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shadows of Sindal</h2> <i>Shadows of Sindal</i> is a three-part campaign <i> </i> set against the backdrop of the <i>Pirates of Drinax</i> .

King Oleb expects a quick return with a huge payoff, but nothing is ever that simple.<br> <strong>In Search of Sindal:</strong> <i> </i> The Travellers voyage to Paal and search for the vault. They discover that someone has used a horrific bioweapon against Aslan settlers in the world's remote outback. Rather than killing them it has turned the warlike but noble Aslan into deranged murderers. The vault does indeed contain treasure, but not the sort King Oleb is expecting.<br> <strong>The Plague of Sindal:</strong> <i> </i> Reports that the bioweapon has been used on other bands of Aslan suggest someone is testing it before attacking a major world. Tensions are rising; it seems likely the Aslan Hierate will strike to pre-empt the threat, and the border worlds will suffer the consequences.
