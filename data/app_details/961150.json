{"about_the_game":"Continue the Star Control: Origins story with Earth Rising! Now that humans are a major player on the galactic scene, one question remains: how will they use their influence, and how will their interstellar neighbors feel about it?<br><br>Earth Rising is a 4-part expansion that contains new quests, ships, rewards, and story that is tied to humanity\u2019s quest for establishing themselves as a major galactic power. Explore new stars, solve newly discovered mysteries, and form relationships with new alien races and their leaders. <br><br>What mark will you leave on the galaxy? Will it be for good, or for ill? Answer that question and much more in Earth Rising.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><strong>Part 1: Aftermath</strong> | <i>Available Now</i><br>Star Control has ordered the construction of a new base in Epsilon Trireme, but not every alien is happy about the idea of an expanding human empire and the base construction efforts have already encountered major trouble. Meanwhile, a suspiciously helpful group of aliens have returned and directed you toward the location of a potential new ally - a race of lazy aliens called the Gloosh. A new enemy has also appeared in the shadows, and it seems to have its own long and hostile history with humanity\u2026<br><br><strong>Part 2: Return of the Lexites</strong> | <i>Available Now</i><br>Face your most dangerous challenge yet against a post-singularity species whose motives are a mystery! The Lexites are impeding Earth's efforts to expand into known space. But, why?

Two new factions have appeared on the scene: The Syndicate, a group of criminals, pirates, and other people of low moral quality, and The Liberators, an organization of idealistic freedom fighters. Both want your allegiance, and both want to destroy each other, which leaves you with a question: where do your loyalties lie? <br><br><strong>Part 4: Earth Rises</strong> | <i>Available Now</i><br>Humans have finally proven that they may be worthy custodians to the Spur, but they must still prove themselves to allies and enemies alike. Meanwhile, Commander Magara is missing, a faction of humanity is developing a dangerous battlecruiser, and the Mowlings\u2019 God has reluctantly returned and asked you to help save them from destruction. Perhaps a stop at Kapteyn\u2019s bar will give you some more information - if you can avoid getting into a brawl long enough to talk to someone, that is.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961150/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1726777597","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961150/page.bg.jpg?t=1726777597","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961150/aafe0fd1ca0a387e267ee51564730096a5182586/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726777597","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/961150/aafe0fd1ca0a387e267ee51564730096a5182586/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726777597","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"PvP","id":49},{"description":"Online PvP","id":36},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen PvP","id":37},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Steam Trading Cards","id":29},{"description":"Steam Workshop","id":30},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Steam Cloud","id":23},{"description":"Stats","id":15},{"description":"Includes level editor","id":17},{"description":"Remote Play Together","id":44},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Continue the Star Control: Origins story with Earth Rising!
