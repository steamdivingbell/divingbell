The story line revolves around 10 legendary Egyptian artifacts that should be found. A player\u2019s path runs through 120 unique game-levels \u2013 puzzles. The player will have to open 15 various mini-games: ranging from Hidden objects to Nilotic mahjong. The action of the game goes around construction and development of a town that the player reigns over. A great number of available constructions and decorative elements, full freedom in town-design plus game-bonuses that town constructions account for, will make a strategic process of town running extremely interesting and breathtaking. The player will be surrounded by responsive assistants and therefore will be able to concentrate only on puzzle-solving. It\u2019s worth mentioning the range of options of this game to create, modify and decorate the player\u2019s avatar. There is a face generator and a clothes shop in the game (70 items for a male avatar and 75 \u2013 for a female avatar). Two extra games, classical Lines and Collapse, will go together with the main game.
