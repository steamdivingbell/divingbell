{"about_the_game":"Kreedz Climbing is a special kind of Platformer + Jump &amp; Run + Race + Puzzle in 3D. It is a challenging movement based game that can be very addictive. Whether casually or in strong competition, there is always something to learn and do! The challenge is to beat the course in the fastest time possible. A checkpoint system allows you to return to a saved position if you fail, but you are truly a great &quot;Ath1337&quot; if you can beat the courses without them.<br><br>The best part is that it is totally free to play!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><br><strong>- Learn the core 7 disciplines in the Tutorial, then find the rest in the various maps!</strong><br>Jump, Surf, Bunnyhop, Bungee, Powerjump, DoubleDuck, Long Jump, Raceway, Bhop Raceway, Deathtraps, Flare Targets. There are single discipline and multiple discipline courses!<br><br><strong>- 120+ maps to choose from</strong><br>The sky is the limit in Kreedz mapping.

Play it alone, play it alone with friends around, or play it with friends. Co-op maps must be played with 2-4 players using boosting and same time puzzle actions.
