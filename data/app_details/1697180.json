In this world, Elemental cards are a popular card battle game played by all. The cards are based on classical and new elements. Anyone can play with the cards, that is why they are so popular. Some have the rare ability to summon the cards Elemental powers for use in the real world! Protect and help others using this special gift against mischief and crime. What if you had that power? What would you do? Start your journey in Elemental card playing like everyone else. Along the way explore, collect, and level up your cards to become the Elemental Card Champion - you may discover the power within yourself.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1697180/extras/battle-draft.gif?t=1658696816\" /><br><i>Up to 4 v 4 cards on the table per battle, may combine cards as well - accelerated for gif</i><br><br>Your journey starts with a dream, to become the greatest Elemental card user in the world!
