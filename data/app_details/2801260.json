{"about_the_game":"Be the hero the world needs in such a desperate time. A meteorite crashes into Earth, leaving a dangerous amount of radiation that engulfs a huge area of a city, horribly mutating humans and exposing them to lethal levels of radiation. Alongside the meteor, unknown celestial aliens arrive with plans unknown for the planet and a powerful yet dangerous substance known as celestial ore. This resource has many different properties depending on the human it reaches. It can be radioactive to lethal levels, transforming humans into raging, nearly mindless mutants aggressively and aimlessly fighting without end. In special cases, a few humans are mutated, granting them special abilities at random. These abilities can vary from lightning and super strength to super regeneration, fire, or anything else based on random mutations from person to person.<br><br>You fight against many powerful bosses and formidable foes willing to do anything to get their hands on celestial ore, to stop them from using it for their own evil purposes. On top of all that lies the bigger problem at hand: what exactly came down to Earth inside the meteor, what it is, and what will happen to the planet if it's not handled in time. It all depends on you as the last hope to save the world!<br><br><br><strong>Features</strong> <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">  <li>Fight Powerful bosses.<br><br></li><li>Gain New Abilities.<br><br></li><li>Find New Weapons.</li></ul><br>Trailer Music from - Symphonic_Metal_Music_For_Games by Intersonic Sound - Music - Aug 16, 2023","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2801260?t=1707843747","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2801260?t=1707843747","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2801260/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1707843747","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2801260/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1707843747","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"Be the hero the world needs in such a desperate time.
