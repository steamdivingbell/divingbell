They don't learn new skills as they grow stronger. In order to learn new skills, Ferromon undergo absorption by using the absorption stone. This stone allows Ferromon to absorb other Ferromon to gain one of their skills. Ferromon with lower stats tend to have better skills, so absorbing a good move from a low stat monster into a high stat monster is favorable.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2194880/extras/unknown__4_.png?t=1734742390\" /><br><br>Once some Ferromon reach a certain level, if you have an emergence stone in your world, they can emerge into a stronger form.
