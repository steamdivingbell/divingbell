Better start spinning your blade the other way before that happens. You must find the right moment to do so.<br>Your footwork is important, too! Your movement will influence that of your blade and vice-versa, opening up a higher skill-ceiling. Positioning, quick decision-making and environmental awareness are key to surviving the endless onslaught.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wave Based Horde Survival</h2><br>A multitude of enemies with different abilities and behaviour patterns will come at you in huge waves with dozens or even hundreds of enemies on screen at once. Each successive wave will have different enemy types and increased levels of challenge. There are several battlefields to choose from, each with different environmental factors and enemy composition. At the end of each one, you will face a powerful boss monster with unique abilities. Try to beat him with every weapon to earn trophies and make it further and further to increase your highscore!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Quick and Satisfying Action</h2><br>The game lets you get right into the satisfying experience of seeing your defeated enemies burst into a cloud of pixels. A typical run lasts only a couple of minutes, getting longer the better you play. Perfect for a quick play session in-between, or a longer one trying to up your game and beat your highscore.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2866000/extras/page-gif-3-small.gif?t=1725450041\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Historical Weapons and Armor to Unlock</h2><br>By surviving for longer and longer each attempt and defeating hundreds or thousands of monsters, you will earn points that you can spend to unlock a variety of weapons and armor for future runs.
