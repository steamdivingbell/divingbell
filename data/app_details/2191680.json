{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You are the sovereign of a town called Mistwinter Bay. The sovereign you create decides the fate of the town and everyone in it. Decide which buildings to build and who gets to live in town. Interact with your townsfolk by sending them on missions or hang out one-on-one. Each character is unique, with their own profession, personal history and strengths and weaknesses. Deal with international politics by befriending or becoming enemies with powerful foreign leaders. Watch the seasons pass as you are faced with a unique, random event every month. The way you decide to handle an event not only affects the ending of the event itself, but the entire town. Will you become a sovereign loved by all or will you adapt your choices to please someone in town \u2013 or perhaps someone across the sea?</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191680/extras/Character_steam.png?t=1735124711\" /><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2191680/extras/CC.png?t=1735124711\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Create the sovereign you want to be with the powerful character creator.
