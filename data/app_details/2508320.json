{"about_the_game":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Rifts(R) for Savage Worlds: Atlantis and the Demon Seas Sourcebook</h2>  EXPLORE THE ALIEN AND BIZARRE <br> Shrouded by the Demon Seas, birthplace of a wondrous human civilization,\u00a0and now host to a bizarre cosmic evil: Atlantis is a threat like no other. The massive isle is ruled by the\u00a0Splugorth, and from it their tendrils of influence snake out across Rifts(R) Earth. Yet the\u00a0Splugorth are not the only threat inhabiting the treacherous waters--the\u00a0Horune Pirates,\u00a0Naut'Yll invaders, and the\u00a0Lord of the Deep\u00a0also haunt the world's oceans. On their own, each of these menaces is a curse to humanity at sea and onshore. Together, they endanger intelligent life across the planet!  <strong> MYSTERIOUS NEW ALLIES GATHER!</strong>   Resisting such malign force may seem impossible, but the Tomorrow Legion is gathering equally powerful allies to battle the oncoming storm. The\u00a0True Atlanteans\u00a0and their ancient cousins\u00a0the Lemurians\u00a0are eager to join the battle against their ancient enemies. The\u00a0New Navy, a remnant of the naval might of the long-gone USA, is also ready to join the fight. Working together the forces of good can turn the dark tide, but it won't be easy.  To succeed, our heroes must harness the power of\u00a0exotic new gear\u00a0including the legendary\u00a0rune weapons, discover the power of\u00a0tattoo magic, unearth the might of\u00a0Bio-Wizardry, and learn to control the enigmatic\u00a0magic stone pyramids\u00a0which first opened Earth to the Megaverse(R).  Fight back against the chthonic horrors bent on terror and subjugation!\u00a0Survive the wrath of monsters from the depths in new Savage Tales, and discover Atlantis in a\u00a0heroic Plot Point Campaign\u00a0fighting against the Minions of Splugorth.  Rifts(R):\u00a0Atlantis and the Demon Seas is adapted from the 192-page full-color sourcebook with new Iconic Frameworks, MARS packages, Edges, Races, and Gear.  This product requires the Savage Worlds core rules, revised for use with Savage Worlds Adventure Edition and the revised edition of Rifts(R): The Tomorrow Legion Player's Guide\u00a0and Rifts(R): Game Master's Handbook. &quot;","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2508320?t=1689082232","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/2508320?t=1689082232","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508320/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1689082232","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508320/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1689082232","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Multi-player","id":1},{"description":"Co-op","id":9},{"description":"Online Co-op","id":38},{"description":"LAN Co-op","id":48},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen Co-op","id":39},{"description":"Shared/Split Screen","id":24},{"description":"Cross-Platform Multiplayer","id":27},{"description":"Downloadable Content","id":21},{"description":"Partial Controller Support","id":18},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Rifts(R) for Savage Worlds: Atlantis and the Demon Seas Sourcebook</h2>  EXPLORE THE ALIEN AND BIZARRE <br> Shrouded by the Demon Seas, birthplace of a wondrous human civilization,\u00a0and now host to a bizarre cosmic evil: Atlantis is a threat like no other.
