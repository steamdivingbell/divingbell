{"about_the_game":"Base has been attacked and you are the last hope of saving Pure Metal.  Shoot down hoards of enemies and unforgiving bosses in classic shooter style.  Touch controls feature smooth analog from the onscreen D-pad.  Use the arrow keys and the z and x buttons to shoot the enemy with the keyboard.  You have one life to make it through each level, but don't worry your ship can take 3 consecutive hits before being destroyed.  Also your ship will regenerate to full power if you can manage to avoid enemy fire long enough.  Bob and weave your way through the enemy fire and kill every thing in site.  This game is designed to brutally come after you but pay attention and look for the patterns and avoid the onslaught of bullets.","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/757050?t=1591762364","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/757050?t=1591762364","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757050/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1591762364","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/757050/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1591762364","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Full controller support","id":28},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Base has been attacked and you are the last hope of saving Pure Metal.
