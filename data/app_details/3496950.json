{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\">\u201cAurora Flight\u201d is a fighter simulation game set on the unknown planet Zenoa. As Javelin, the leader of the Phalanx Squadron formed by the major corporation Teracom, you will join your comrades Spear and Lance in fierce battles against the mysterious intelligence known as Exis. Up to Mission 10 is currently implemented. The early part of the story features small-scale engagements against old-fashioned planes and reconnaissance craft, but the enemy rapidly learns humanity\u2019s technology and deploys stealth aircraft. As you fight through base defense missions and large-scale aerial skirmishes, you\u2019ll discover that Exis poses a far greater threat than you ever imagined.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Cooperation with Wingmates</strong><br>One of the major attractions of this game is the system that allows you to issue specific orders to your wingmates, Spear and Lance, thereby controlling their actions. You can swiftly eliminate a strong foe with concentrated fire, or disperse your wingmates to suppress enemies on multiple fronts\u2014there are many possible tactics. Since your allies will retreat if they take too much damage, it\u2019s crucial to give timely orders and provide cover. Skillful coordination with friendly forces is key to overcoming dire situations.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Fighter Customization</strong><br>The degree of freedom in modifying and equipping your aircraft is very high. In addition to weapons such as missiles and machine guns, you can also install options like enhanced propulsion or improved maneuverability. While powerful armaments let you efficiently take down enemies, they may come with score penalties or make balancing your aircraft trickier. Finding the optimal setup to suit your personal strategy is part of the fun.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><strong>Realistic Flight Mechanics</strong><br>Basic principles like losing speed when climbing or gaining speed when descending directly impact your tactics. Attempting too tight a turn can lead to a stall, possibly preventing you from evading incoming missiles. This aspect of energy management adds tension and strategic depth to aerial combat.
