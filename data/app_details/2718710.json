{"about_the_game":"Hello and welcome to &quot;It Mimcs&quot;. This is a project I've been working on for a few months based on the original Slenderman game (The Eight Pages)<br />\r\nBuilt in UE5, It Mimics is a classic indie horror game exploring a moderate-sized map to collect eight different pages. Players will constantly be followed by a monster who never loses the player's trail. This requires players to time when they go into a certain area to retrieve each page. <br />\r\nThe game comes with three modes to play to provide some replayability if the player chooses. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNight Mode - Night mode is the default and suggested game mode for the player. The entire game was designed around this game mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDaytime mode - For those who want a brighter, yet still creepy experience, daytime provides the player with some beautiful sunshine. However, morning fog will do its best to block what light it can still. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChallenge Mode - Based on the night mode, challenge mode spawns multiple monsters for the player to juggle and evade as they collect the pages. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you enjoy short indie horror games that are a bit of a walking/running experience, without the loud jumpscares, then I'm sure you're in for a treat.","background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2718710/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1703535928","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2718710/page.bg.jpg?t=1703535928","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2718710/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1703535928","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2718710/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1703535928","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[5],"notes":"General horror warnings, blood on the monster, and an instance of a curse word being written on paper."},"detailed_description":"Hello and welcome to &quot;It Mimcs&quot;.
