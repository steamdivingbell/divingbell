The sprites were expertly crafted, the dialogue intriguing, the small cast of characters were endearing, or (In two character's cases) left you wanting more from them. I'd really love to meet the rest of the cast, and all, because I find the use of card-themed battling game play with certain risks or advantages  resulting from the position of your card unique and fascinating. I would love to find out the attributes of the other card colors, as well as get to know the full story. I hope for a full release of the game besides the demo, and am very invested in it's development.\u201d<br />\r\nOnly Single Player<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cChromatose unexpected made me care for the characters a lot...
