{"about_the_game":"Idol Quest VR is a single-player exploration-adventure shooter with a simple premise: Discover the lost idol.  To do so you will need to solve puzzles and avoid or defend yourself against dangerous wildlife and other perils in large, open environments.  <br><br>Both natural (arm-swing plus head-bob) and artificial locomotion play styles are supported, and you are free to run, swim, and climb as you please.  You are supplied with a knife, a backpack (for storing various pickupables), dual pistols, dual uzis (on some levels), 92 rounds of pistol ammo, a pump-action shotgun, and 18 rounds of shotgun ammo; all weapons handling is detailed and takes full advantage of vr motion controllers.  <br><br>Each level has its secrets, including four randomly placed crystals.  Will you discover them all?  Will you survive to find the idol?<br><br><i>Note for Oculus Rift users: Ensure you launch the game from your Steam Library and choose the second option, &quot;Launch Oculus Rift in Oculus VR Mode&quot;.
