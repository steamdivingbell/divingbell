{"about_the_game":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">POWER CRISIS is an unnerving puzzle/resource-management game, where you have nothing but your mind, a light, and your superhuman electrical abilities to help you avoid obstacles, ward off enemies, and progress between test chambers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, you'll need to interact with special components-- plenty of which need to be powered by your stored electricity. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For some chambers, you're given constant access to a generator, which you can use to charge up. Oftentimes though, your ability to access this generator is limited. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">While a misuse of power could mean nothing more than a slight time loss, there is another problem that can arise... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Bee, the player character, is deeply afraid of the dark. And, seeing what lies within it, you won't blame them. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">First, being in the dark for too long will cause Bee to panic, giving you a slight setback on time. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">But, more pressing, you're not alone-- and you'll wish you were. Your light is your only weapon against the creatures that live within the dark. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Of course, beyond survival, there is one more reason you'll want to be efficient with your power usage... </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This mission isn't without consequences. The world depends on you, and as such, you need to prove you're up for the task. Once your test officially begins, your Power Rating score will continuously decrement. Each time you're knocked out, you will also face a penalty to this score.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">The higher the score you have by the end, the better grade you will receive. If your score reaches 0, your mission will end. Speaking of which. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You've been tasked with something you've been training for your entire life-- the preparation of a mysterious new power source, which should be powerful enough to save humanity from a new, incoming apocalypse. On your mission, you will have to use your power and your wits to interact with different mechanisms to ultimately allow you to progress. With a handful of different components to work with, you will constantly have to learn how new mechanisms work and interact with one another.  In this mission, your quick thinking is your only lifeline. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p>","background":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3366860?t=1733820231","background_raw":"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/3366860?t=1733820231","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3366860/eb3c8592a3d62bf05b2245240aa98e1eeec403d0/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1733820231","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3366860/eb3c8592a3d62bf05b2245240aa98e1eeec403d0/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1733820231","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Game demo","id":10}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">POWER CRISIS is an unnerving puzzle/resource-management game, where you have nothing but your mind, a light, and your superhuman electrical abilities to help you avoid obstacles, ward off enemies, and progress between test chambers. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you progress, you'll need to interact with special components-- plenty of which need to be powered by your stored electricity. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">For some chambers, you're given constant access to a generator, which you can use to charge up.
