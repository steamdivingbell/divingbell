{"about_the_game":"Inspired by 1980's arcade games, <strong>Pair of Aces</strong> is a fast-paced action game where you throw all you have at the enemy fleet in order to sink their ships before they escape.<br><br>Play <strong>solo</strong> or with a friend in same-screen <strong>co-op mode</strong> to sink convoy after convoy of the enemy fleet, or play head-to-head <strong>Dogfight</strong> and sink your opponent's carrier before they sink yours.<br><br>Drop bombs and enemy wreckage on the ships to destroy the superstructure and punch holes in the hull, get help by destroying sea-mines which will punch three holes in the enemy's hull, right at the waterline!<br><br>Aim your bombs carefully and avoid the enemy flak cannons -- they will throw you off-course.<br><br>If you crash, don't worry: you have an infinite supply of fighter planes, but you can't fight the good fight while you're sight-seeing in a parachute.","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Perfect
