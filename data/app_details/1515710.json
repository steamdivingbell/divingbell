That sounds like something you would do, right? It must be because you're here and you don't remember anything from before. So, where is here exactly and what's your job?<br><br>The Anna series test is set in five stages with five different participants, artificially intelligent replicas of a real person. To push through Alleyne's test and make it out the other side, hopefully alive, you'll have to converse with the replicas. Follow their stories and make them believe they are human. The complication? Only one replica is needed to end the test.<br><br>Each phase Dr Alleyne will have you power down one of the machines. Removing them from testing and ending their stories. Sounds simple enough on paper. Flick a switch and turn off a machine. But you've got to know these women, their stories, their lives, seen their humanity. Can you bring yourself to keep flicking the switches? Can you separate their humanity from your own? Should you feel guilt for sentencing a machine to an unknown fate? <br><br>Take a psychological trip into Alleyne's deprived test of mental stability to find out.
