Starting from Coconut Grunt, collect tropical fruit to process into delicious beverages, while avoiding the not-so-friendly creatures that live alongside the lush groves of coconuts, bananas, and cacao. As you travel through all 12 fields, the tasks get harder, but your monkey has the chance to level-up and gain new inventory that will help conquer the crops. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082290/extras/collectprocess.png?t=1662044704\" /><br>First, your Monkey must find fruit trees and shake them to drop their luscious fruit. A simple click adds them to your inventory. Look around for a sack to carry more fruit!  Once you have collected the fruit, make your way to the Hopper and dump the fruit in so it can process into cartons of coconut-milk based beverages!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082290/extras/travelfields.png?t=1662044704\" /><br>After completing a Field's harvest under the time allotted, you will unlock the next Field on the Field Trail.  Feel like you could have done better time-wise on any field? Just go back and replay the Field and earn a quicker time, or find the hidden Swag item you missed!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2082290/extras/collecting.png?t=1662044704\" /><br>Oh yes, I did say Swag item! Each field has a special piece of Swag your Monkey can collect and, in the &quot;Options&quot; menu, don on their furry little heads!
