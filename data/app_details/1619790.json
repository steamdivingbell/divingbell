{"about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/extras/Shots2-1.gif?t=1667998478\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The game</h2>Aggressor is a stylized, physics-based air combat Shoot 'Em Up. It's all about defeating the enemy and watching them go down in a blaze of glory. The player progresses by completing missions and destroying enemy aircraft. For those interested in quick action, there is an instant dogfight gamemode in which you can rapidly configure your own battles with all aircraft available. The game features 30+ player-flyable aircraft and over 20 distinct weapon types, with both these lists ever expanding. The majority of the roster is made up of classic cold-war era fighters but also many lesser known prototypes and fictional planes with unique flight controls. <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/extras/yb35gif.gif?t=1667998478\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2><br><strong>If you are experiencing issues with gamepad controls or anything else for that matter, make sure Steam Input is disabled.</strong><br><br>If you want to fly well in this game you need to have some understanding of traditional flight physics. Control-wise this is no arcade title, understand that this is a game for pilots and there is a learning curve you have to devote yourself to. Those coming from true arcade titles may have trouble getting used to it. On the bright side, no air combat manuever is out of reach when one masters true flight controls. There is a mouse aimed control scheme you can toggle with right click for those not in possession of a joystick.<br><br>The game offers a number of control schemes and a wide array of options for configuring these. Beginner or seasoned virtual pilot, anyone can jump in and fly high speed fighter jets without limits. Aircraft can be controlled with mouse, keyboard, joysticks, gamepads but will require some configuration to get it all set up. For any questions or help I am always available on here or in the discord.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Damage Model</h2>Aircraft in the game feature a very complex damage model. Every aircraft is divided into parts which are connected through physics joints. These parts each run their own damage calculations and physics iterations. The full list of damage-related features is a long one but here are some prominent ones:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fuel tanks can rupture and/or catch on fire<br></li><li>Parts can be shot off, disintegrate and/or explode<br></li><li>Lift/drag changes from damage to aerodynamic surfaces<br></li><li>Powerplant failures<br></li><li>Hydraulic failures<br></li><li>Jammed control surfaces<br></li><li>Structural failure</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Setting</h2>The game spans the cold war-modern time period and will cover future warfare too. By completing missions, new weapons can be unlocked and equipped. A wide variety of weapons are available in the loadout editor. From gunpods to bombs to air-to-air missiles, there are plenty of ways to disrespect your opponents in spectacular fashion.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">State of the game</h2>Aggressor is currently in early access. This means not all of the content and features are in place yet. I'm developing this game on my own and expect to be doing so for the rest of Aggressors development timeline. I've recently gotten to the point where I can start adding more content without too much risk of breaking stuff, thus I will be doing so consistently until the game is complete in my eyes. This is also a good time for player feedback and suggestions for things to add.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHECK DISCORD FOR THE LATEST ON AGGRESSOR!</h2><strong></strong>","achievements":{"highlighted":[{"name":"Supersonic","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/caea861ec070540c10d51eb6d2617582edbf1246.jpg"},{"name":"Kamikaze","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/5d375b8917191209b88e261034959610c76f9b97.jpg"},{"name":"No Quarter","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/7cf35225d6b1a9285a755c997d815103e6045033.jpg"},{"name":"The Big One","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/7363d15a0c55f2696353df31cb98dab7e85347b6.jpg"},{"name":"Big Gun","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/d7f89a8cf11a22daeab75a57641d677aa2455048.jpg"},{"name":"Mach 2","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/5670ada73986fc38b1aa59220b1386124d69c056.jpg"},{"name":"First Blood","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/cd6e018c8f707eb305a416d87c40cccea1499868.jpg"},{"name":"Air Racer","path":"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/1619790/956ae5aa5b2029d534a2b597da9c411bf101291e.jpg"}],"total":8},"background":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1667998478","background_raw":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/page.bg.jpg?t=1667998478","capsule_image":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1667998478","capsule_imagev5":"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1667998478","categories":[{"description":"Single-player","id":2},{"description":"Steam Achievements","id":22},{"description":"Family Sharing","id":62}],"content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null},"detailed_description":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1619790/extras/Shots2-1.gif?t=1667998478\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The game</h2>Aggressor is a stylized, physics-based air combat Shoot 'Em Up.
