{"about_the_game":"2048 - temperatures are rising and ocean currents are stagnating. Coral reefs everywhere are barren and lifeless. Your conservation team have a unique opportunity to protect what remains of the reef. You'll need to make some bold innovations to give it a fighting chance. Your efforts always come with a risk of unforeseen consequences. Will the reef survive? <br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2620540/extras/headline3.png?t=1695972352\" /><br>Conduct dives to identify new corals that might provide answers to how to save the reef. Could you expand the coral gene pool to improve the reef's health? Could you uncover new medicines that will provide much needed funding?
