Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g., decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head"},"detailed_description":"Journey back to the Golden Age of Heathmoor with the Hero Skin of Ramiel, a full-body customization of the First Warden.
